= class Gtk::Bin
The Gtk::Bin widget is a container with just one child. It is not very useful itself, but it is useful for deriving subclasses, since it provides common code needed for handling a single child widget. 

Many Ruby/GTK widgets are subclasses of Gtk::Bin, including Gtk::Window, Gtk::Button, Gtk::Frame, Gtk::HandleBox, and Gtk::ScrolledWindow.
