= class Gdk::Image

The Gdk::Image type represents an area for drawing graphics. It has now been superceded to a large extent by the much more flexible ((<Gdk::RGB>)) methods.

== Class Methods

--- Gdk::Image.new(type, visual, width, height)

    Creates a new Gdk::Image. 
    * type : the type of the Gdk::Image, one of Gdk::Image::NORMAL, Gdk::Image::SHARED and Gdk::Image::FASTEST. Gdk::Image::FASTEST is probably the best choice, since it will try creating a GDK_IMAGE_SHARED image first and if that fails it will then use Gdk::Image::NORMAL.  
    * visual: the Gdk::Visual to use for the image 
    * width: the width of the image in pixels  
    * height: the height of the image in pixels
    * Returns: a new Gdk::Image

== Instance Methods

--- image_type

    Gets the type of the image. 
    * Returns: the tyepe of the image(((<GdkImageType|Gdk::Image#GdkImageType>)))

--- visual

    Gets the visual.
    * Returns: the Gdk::Visual

--- width

    Gets the width of the image in pixels. 
    * Returns: the width of the image in pixels.

--- height

    Gets the height of the image in pixels. 
    * Returns: the height of the image in pixels.

--- depth

    Gets the depth of the image, i.e. the number of bits per pixel
    * Returns: the depth of the image.

--- bpp

    Gets the number of bytes per pixel. 
    * Returns: the number of bytes per pixel

--- bpl

    Gets the number of bytes per line of the image.
    * Returns: the number of bytes per of the image.

--- bits_per_pixel

    Gets the number of bits per pixel.
    * Returns: the number of bits per pixel.

--- colormap

    Retrieves the colormap for a given image, if it exists. An image will have a colormap if the drawable from which it was created has a colormap, or if a colormap was set explicitely with Gdk::Image#colormap=.
    * Returns : colormap for the image

--- colormap=(colormap)

    Sets the colormap for the image to the given colormap. Normally there's no need to use this method, images are created with the correct colormap if you get the image from a drawable. If you create the image from scratch, use the colormap of the drawable you intend to render the image to.
    * colormap: a Gdk::Colormap
    * Returns: colormap

--- set_colormap(colormap)

    Same as Gdk::Image#colormap=.
    * colormap: a Gdk::Colormap
    * Returns: self

--- put_pixel(x, y, pixel)

    Sets a pixel in a Gdk::Image to a given pixel value. 
    * x: the x coordinate of the pixel to set.  
    * y: the y coordinate of the pixel to set.  
    * pixel: the pixel value to set.  
    * Returns: self

--- get_pixel(x, y)

    Gets a pixel value at a specified position in a Gdk::Image. 
    * x: the x coordinate of the pixel to get.  
    * y: the y coordinate of the pixel to get.  
    * Returns: the pixel value at the given position.

--- byte_order

     * Returns: self: ((*FIXME*))

== Constants

=== GdkImageType

Specifies the type of a Gdk::Image.

--- NORMAL

    The original X image type, which is quite slow since the image has to be transferred from the client to the server to display it.

--- SHARED

    A faster image type, which uses shared memory to transfer the image data between client and server. However this will only be available if client and server are on the same machine and the shared memory extension is supported by the server.

--- FASTEST

    Specifies that Gdk::Image::SHARED should be tried first, and if that fails then Gdk::Image::NORMAL will be used.
