= class Gtk::RadioButton

Gtk::RadioButton is for a choice from multiple check buttons.
A single radio button performs the same basic function as a Gtk::CheckButton, as it's position in the object hierarchy reflects. It is only when multiple radio buttons are grouped together that they become a different user interface component in their own right.

Every radio button is a member of some group of radio buttons. When one is selected, all other radio buttons in the same group are deselected. A Gtk::RadioButton is one way of giving the user a choice from many options.
