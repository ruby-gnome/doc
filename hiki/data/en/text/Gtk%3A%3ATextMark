= class Gtk::TextMark

A Gtk::TextMark is like a bookmark in a text buffer; it preserves a position in the text. You can convert the mark to an iterator using Gtk::TextBuffer#iter_at_mark. Unlike iterators, marks remain valid across buffer mutations, because their behavior is defined when text is inserted or deleted. When text containing a mark is deleted, the mark remains in the position originally occupied by the deleted text. When text is inserted at a mark, a mark with left gravity will be moved to the beginning of the newly-inserted text, and a mark with right gravity will be moved to the end. "left" and "right" here refer to logical direction (left is the toward the start of the buffer); in some languages such as Hebrew the logically-leftmost text is not actually on the left when displayed.

Marks optionally have names; these can be convenient to avoid passing the Gtk::TextMark object around.

Marks are typically created using the Gtk::TextBuffer#create_mark.

== Class Methods

--- Gtk::TextMark.new

     * Returns: self: ((*FIXME*))

== Instance Methods

--- buffer

    Gets the Gtk::TextBuffer this mark is located inside, or nil if the mark is deleted.
    * Returns: Gtk::TextBuffer

--- deleted?

    Returns true if the mark has been removed from its buffer with Gtk::TextBuffer#delete_mark. Marks can't be used once deleted.
    * Returns: true or false

--- left_gravity?

    Determines whether the mark has left gravity.
    * Returns: true if the mark has left gravity, false otherwise

--- name

    Returns the mark name; returns nil for anonymous marks.
    * Returns:  mark name or nil

--- visible?

    Returns true if the mark is visible (i.e. a cursor is displayed for it)
    * Returns: true or false

--- visible=(setting)

    Sets the visibility of mark; the insertion point is normally visible, i.e. you can see it as a vertical bar. Also, the text widget uses a visible mark to indicate where a drop will occur when dragging-and-dropping text. Most other marks are not visible. Marks are not visible by default.
    * setting: visibility of mark (true or false)
    * Returns: setting

--- set_visible(setting)

    Same as Gtk::TextMark#visible=.
    * setting: visibility of mark (true or false)
    * Returns: Gtk::TextMark

--- line

     * Returns: self: ((*FIXME*))

--- marker_type

     * Returns: self: ((*FIXME*))

--- marker_type=

     * Returns: self: ((*FIXME*))

--- next

     * Returns: self: ((*FIXME*))

--- prev

--- set_marker_type

     * Returns: self: ((*FIXME*))
