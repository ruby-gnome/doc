= class Gtk::TextTagTable

A Gtk::TextTagTable defines a set of tags that can be used together. Each Gtk::TextBuffer has one tag table associated with it; only tags from that tag table can be used with the buffer. A single tag table can be shared between multiple buffers, however.

== Instance Methods

--- add(tag)

    tag must not be in a tag table already, and may not have the same name as an already-added tag.
