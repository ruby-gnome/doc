= class Gtk::Alignment
The Gtk::Alignment widget controls the alignment and size of its child widget. It has four settings: xscale, yscale, xalign, and yalign. 

The scale settings are used to specify how much the child widget should expand to fill the space allocated to the Gtk::Alignment. The values can range from 0 (meaning the child doesn't expand at all) to 1 (meaning the child expands to fill all of the available space). 

The align settings are used to place the child widget within the available area. The values range from 0 (top or left) to 1 (bottom or right). Of course, if the scale settings are both set to 1, the alignment settings have no effect.

              * Gtk::Alignment

== Class Methods
--- Gtk::Alignment.new(xalign, yalixn, xscale, yscale)
    Creates a new Gtk::Alignment. 
    * xalign: the horizontal alignment of the child widget, from 0 (left) to 1 (right).  
    * yalign: the vertical alignment of the child widget, from 0 (top) to 1 (bottom).  
    * xscale: the amount that the child widget expands horizontally to fill up unused space, from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates that the child widget should never expand. A value of 1 indicates that the child widget will expand to fill all of the space allocated for the Gtk::Alignment.  
    * yscale: the amount that the child widget expands vertically to fill up unused space, from 0 to 1. The values are similar to xscale.  
    * Returns: a new Gtk::Alignment.

== Instance Methods
--- set(xalign, yalign, xscale, yscale)
    Sets the Gtk::Alignment values. 
    * xalign: the horizontal alignment of the child widget, from 0 (left) to 1 (right).  
    * yalign: the vertical alignment of the child widget, from 0 (top) to 1 (bottom).  
    * xscale: the amount that the child widget expands horizontally to fill up unused space, from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates that the child widget should never expand. A value of 1 indicates that the child widget will expand to fill all of the space allocated for the Gtk::Alignment.  
    * yscale: the amount that the child widget expands vertically to fill up unused space, from 0 to 1. The values are similar to xscale.

== Properties
--- xalign: Float (Read/Write)
    Horizontal position of child in available space. 0.0 is left aligned, 1.0 is right aligned

--- xscale: Float (Read/Write)
    If available horizontal space is bigger than needed for the child, how much of it to use for the child. 0.0 means none, 1.0 means all

--- yalign: Float (Read/Write)
    Vertical position of child in available space. 0.0 is top aligned, 1.0 is bottom aligned

--- yscale: Float (Read/Write)
    If available vertical space is bigger than needed for the child, how much of it to use for the child. 0.0 means none, 1.0 means all
