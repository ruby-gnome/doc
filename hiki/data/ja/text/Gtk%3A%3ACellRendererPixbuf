The Gtk::CellRendererPixbuf is used for rendering a cell to a Gdk::Drawable with Gdk::Pixbuf. 

== Object Hierarchy
* Object
  * GLib::Instantiatable
    * GLib::Object
      * Gtk::Object
        * Gtk::CellRenderer
          * Gtk::CellRendererPixbuf

== Class Methods
--- Gtk::CellRendererPixbuf.new
    Creates a new Gtk::CellRendererPixbuf. Adjust rendering parameters using object properties. Object properties can be set globally (with GLib::Object#set_property). Also, with Gtk::TreeViewColumn, you can bind a property to a value in a Gtk::TreeModel. For example, you can bind the "pixbuf" property on the cell renderer to a pixbuf value in the model, thus rendering a different image in each row of the Gtk::TreeView.
