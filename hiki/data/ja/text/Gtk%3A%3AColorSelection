== Instance Methods
--- has_opacity_control?

--- has_opacity_control=(has_opacity)
    Sets the colorsel to use or not use opacity.
    * has_opacity: true if colorsel can set the opacity, false otherwise. 
    * Returns: has_opacity
--- set_has_opacity_control(has_opacity)
    Same as Gtk::ColorSelection#has_opacity_control=.
    * has_opacity: true if colorsel can set the opacity, false otherwise. 
    * Returns: self

--- has_palette?
    Determines whether the color selector has a color palette.
    * Returns: true if the selector has a palette. false if it hasn't. 
--- has_palette=(has_palette)
    Shows and hides the palette based upon the value of has_palette.

    * Returns: self

--- current_alpha
    Returns the maximum number of palette colors.
    * Returns: the maximum number of palette indexes. 
--- current_alpha=(alpha)
    Sets the current opacity to be alpha. The first time this is called, it will also set the original opacity to be alpha too.
    * alpha: an integer between 0 and 65535. 
    * Returns: alpha

    Same as Gtk::ColorSelection#current_alpha=.
    * alpha: an integer between 0 and 65535. 
    * Returns: self

--- current_color

    * color: a Gdk::Color to set the previous color with. 
    * Returns: color
--- set_previous_color(color)
    Same as Gtk::ColorSelection#previous_color=.
