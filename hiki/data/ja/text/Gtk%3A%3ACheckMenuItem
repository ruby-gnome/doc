= class Gtk::CheckMenuItem
A Gtk::CheckMenuItem is a menu item that maintains the state of a boolean value in addition to a Gtk::MenuItem's usual role in activating application code. 

A check box indicating the state of the boolean value is displayed at the left side of the Gtk::MenuItem. Activating the Gtk::MenuItem toggles the value.

== Class Methods
--- Gtk::CheckMenuItem.new(label = nil, use_underline = true)
    Creates a new Gtk::CheckMenuItem. 
    * label: the string to use for the label.  
    * use_undeline: true if underscores in label indicate the mnemonic for the menu item.
    * Returns : a new Gtk::CheckMenuItem.  

== Instance Methods
--- active?
    Returns whether the check menu item is active.
    * Returns: true if the menu item is checked.  
   
--- active=(active)
    Sets the active state of the menu item's check box. 
    * active: true if the check box is active.  
    * Returns: active

--- set_active(active)
    Same as Gtk::CheckMenuItem#active=.
    * active: true if the check box is active.  
    * Returns: self

--- inconsistent?
    Retrieves the value set by Gtk::CheckMenuItem#inconsistent=.
    * Returns: true if inconsistent

--- inconsistent=(setting)
    If the user has selected a range of elements (such as some text or spreadsheet cells) that are affected by a boolean setting, and the current values in that range are inconsistent, you may want to display the check in an "in between" state. This function turns on "in between" display. Normally you would turn off the inconsistent state again if the user explicitly selects a setting. This has to be done manually, this method only affects visual appearance, it doesn't affect the semantics of the widget.
    * setting: true to display an "inconsistent" third state check
    * Returns: setting

--- set_inconsistent(setting)
    Same as Gtk::CheckMenuItem#inconsistent=.
    * setting: true to display an "inconsistent" third state check
    * Returns: self

--- toggled
    Emits the ((<Gtk::CheckMenuItem::toggled|Gtk::CheckMenuItem::toggled: self>)) signal. 

== Properties
--- active: true or false (Read/Write)
    Whether the menu item is checked

--- inconsistent: true or false (Read/Write)
    Whether to display an "inconsistent" state

== Signals
--- toggled: self
     * self: Gtk::CheckMenuItem
