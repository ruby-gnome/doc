= class Gtk::AccelLabel
The Gtk::AccelLabel widget is a subclass of Gtk::Label that also displays an accelerator key on the right of the label text, e.g. 'Ctl+S'. It is commonly used in menus to show the keyboard short-cuts for commands. 

The accelerator key to display is not set explicitly. Instead, the Gtk::AccelLabel displays the accelerators which have been added to a particular widget. This widget is set by calling Gtk::AccelLabel#accel_widget=. 

For example, a Gtk::MenuItem widget may have an accelerator added to emit the "activate" signal when the 'Ctl+S' key combination is pressed. A Gtk::AccelLabel is created and added to the Gtk::MenuItem, and Gtk::AccelLabel#accel_widget= is called with the Gtk::MenuItem as the second argument. The Gtk::AccelLabel will now display 'Ctl+S' after its label. 

Note that creating a Gtk::MenuItem with Gtk::MenuItem.new (or one of the similar functions for Gtk::CheckMenuItem and Gtk::RadioMenuItem) automatically adds a Gtk::AccelLabel to the Gtk::MenuItem and calls Gtk::AccelLabel#accel_widget= to set it up for you. 

A Gtk::AccelLabel will only display accelerators which have Gtk::ACCEL_VISIBLE set (see ((<GtkAccelFlags|Gtk#GtkAccelFlags>))). A Gtk::AccelLabel can display multiple accelerators and even signal names, though it is almost always used to display just one accelerator key.

      * Gtk::Object

            * Gtk::Label

== Class Methods
--- Gtk::AccelLabel.new(string)
    Creates a new Gtk::AccelLabel. 
    * string: the label string. Must be non-nil
    * Returns: a new Gtk::AccelLabel

== Instance Methods
--- accel_closure
    Returns the accel_closure.
    * Returns: the accel_closure(GLib::Closure, or nil).

--- accel_closure=(accel_closure)
    Sets the closure to be monitored by this accelerator label. The closure must be connected to an accelerator group; see Gtk::AccelGroup#connect
    * accel_closure: the closure(GLib::Closure) to monitor for accelerator changes.  
    * Returns: the accel_closure

--- set_accel_closure(accel_closure)
    Same as Gtk::AccelLabel#accel_closure=.
    * accel_closure: the closure(GLib::Closure) to monitor for accelerator changes.  
    * Returns: self

--- accel_widget
    Fetches the widget monitored by this accelerator label. 
    * Returns : the object monitored by the accelerator label, or nil.  

--- accel_widget=(accel_widget)
    Sets the widget to be monitored by this accelerator label.
    * accel_widget: the widget to be monitored.  
    * Returns: accel_widget

--- set_accel_widget(accel_widget)
    Same as Gtk::AccelLabel#accel_widget=.
    * accel_widget: the widget to be monitored.  
    * Returns: self

--- accel_width
    Returns the width needed to display the accelerator key(s). This is used by menus to align all of the Gtk::MenuItem widgets, and shouldn't be needed by applications. 
    * Returns: the width needed to display the accelerator key(s).  

--- refetch
    Recreates the string representing the accelerator keys. This should not be needed since the string is automatically updated whenever accelerators are added or removed from the associated widget. 
     * accel_label : a Gtk::AccelLabel.  
     * Returns : always returns false.

== Properties
--- accel-closure: GLib::Closure (Read/Write)
    The closure to be monitored for accelerator changes

--- accel-widget: Gtk::Widget (Read/Write)
    The widget to be monitored for accelerator changes
