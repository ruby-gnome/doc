= module Gst
The GStreamer module.

== Module Functions
--- Gst.has_threads?
    This method returns true if GStreamer has threads enabled, false otherwise.
    * Returns: true if GStreamer has threads enabled, false otherwise.

--- Gst.init(*args)
    Initializes the GStreamer library (using *args), setting up internal path 
    lists, registering built-in elements, and loading standard plugins.
    If *args are ommited, GStreamer will be initialized using arguments from the 
    Ruby command line.
    A RuntimeError exception will be raised if GStreamer could not be initialized.
    * Returns: always true, or an exception on failure.

--- Gst.use_threads(state)
    Instructs the core to turn on/off threading. 
    When threading is turned off, all thread operations such as 
    mutexes and conditionals are turned into NOPs. 
    Use this if you want absolute minimal overhead and you don't 
    use any threads in the pipeline.
    * state: a boolean state.  
    * Returns: the provided boolean value.

--- Gst.version
    Gets the version number of the GStreamer library, in an array
    of 3 fixnums, which represent major, minor and macro numbers. 
    	# Prints GStreamer version in a String 'major.minor.macro'
    	p Gst.version.join('.')
    * Returns: an Array of 3 fixnums (major, minor and macro numbers).

--- NSECOND
    Constant that defines one GStreamer nanosecond.
