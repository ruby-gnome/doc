= class Gtk::Plug
Together with Gtk::Socket, Gtk::Plug provides the ability to embed widgets from one process into another process in a fashion that is transparent to the user. One process creates a Gtk::Socket widget and, passes the ID of that widgets window to the other process, which then creates a Gtk::Plug with that window ID. Any widgets contained in the Gtk::Plug then will appear inside the first applications window.

== Class Methods
--- Gtk::Plug.new
    Creates a new plug widget inside the Gtk::Socket identified by socket_id. If socket_id is 0, the plug is left "unplugged" and can later be plugged into a Gtk::Socket by Gtk::Socket#add_id.
    * Returns: the new Gtk::Plug widget.  

== Instance Methods
--- construct(socket_id)
    Finishes the creation of a GtkPlug widget. This function will generally only be used by classes deriving from Gtk::Plug.
    * socket_id: the window ID of the socket.  
    * Returns: self
--- id
    Gets the window ID of a Gtk::Plug widget, which can then be used to embed this window inside another window, for instance with Gtk::Socket#add_id.
    * Returns: the window ID for the plug 

== Signals
--- embeded: self
     * self: Gtk::Plug
