= class Gdk::Event
Handling events from the window system.

== Object Hierarchy
* Object
  * GLib::Boxed
    * Gdk::Event

== Class Methods
--- Gdk::Event.events_pending?
    Checks if any events are ready to be processed for any display.
    * Returns: true if any events are pending.  

--- Gdk::Event.peek
    If there is an event waiting in the event queue of some open display, returns a copy of it.
    * Returns: a copy of the first Gdk::Event on some event queue, or nil if no events are in any queues. 

--- Gdk::Event.get
    Checks all open displays for a Gdk::Event to process,to be processed on, fetching events from the windowing system if necessary. 
    * Returns: the next Gdk::Event to be processed, or nil if no events are pending.

--- Gdk::Event.new(type)
    Creates a new event of the given type. All fields are set to 0.
    You should call this method on concrete classes with a proper event type(Gdk::EventButton, Gdk::EventKey, ...). ((*Since 2.2*))
    * type: a ((<GdkEventType|Gdk::Event#GdkEventType>))
    * Returns: a new Gdk::Event.

--- Gdk::Event.handler_set{|event| ... }
    Sets the block to call to handle all events from GDK. 
    Note that GTK+ uses this to install its own event handler, so it is usually not useful for GTK+ applications. (Although an application can call this method then call Gtk.main_do_event to pass events to GTK+.)
    * {|event| ... }: the block to call to handle events from GDK
      * event: the event
    * Returns: self

--- Gdk::Event.show_events?
    Gets whether event debugging output is enabled.
    * Returns: true if event debugging output is enabled.
--- Gdk::Event.set_show_events(show_events)
    Sets whether a trace of received events is output. Note that GTK+ must be compiled with debugging (that is, configured using the --enable-debug option) to use this option.
    * show_events: true to output event debugging information 
    * Returns: self

--- Gdk::Event.setting_get(name, type = String)
    Obtains a desktop-wide setting, such as the double-click time, for the default screen. See Gdk::Screen#get_setting.
    * name: the name of the setting
    * type: the type of the return value(String, Integer, Gdk::Color)
    * Returns: the value of the setting if existed, otherwise nil

== Instance Methods
--- put
    Appends a copy of the self onto the front of the event queue for Gdk::EventAny#window 's display, or the default event queue if Gdk::Event#window is nil. See Gdk::Display#put_event.
    * Returns: self

--- get_axis(axis_use)
    Extract the axis value for a particular axis use from an event structure.
    * axis_use : the axis use to look for (((<GdkAxisUse|Gdk::Device#GdkAxisUse>)))
    * Returns: the value if the specified axis was found, otherwise nil

--- coords
    Extract the event window relative x/y coordinates from an event.
    * Returns: [x_win, y_win] if the event delivered event window coordinates, otherwise nil
       * x_win: event window x coordinate  
       * y_win: event window y coordinate  

--- root_coords
    Extract the root window relative x/y coordinates from an event.
    * Returns: [x_root, y_root] if the event delivered root window coordinates, otherwise nil
       * x_root: root window x coordinate  
       * y_root: root window y coordinate  

--- event_type
    Returns the event type.
    * Returns: ((<GdkEventType|Gdk::Event#GdkEventType>))

--- screen
    Returns the screen for the event. The screen is typically the screen for Gdk::EventAny#window, but for events such as mouse events, it is the screen where the the pointer was when the event occurs - that is, the screen which has the root window to which Gdk::EventMotion#x_root and Gdk::EventMotion#y_root are relative. ((*Since 2.2*))
    * Returns: the Gdk::Screen for the event
--- screen=(screen)
    Sets the screen for event to screen. The event must have been allocated by GTK+. ((*Since 2.2*))
    * screen: a Gdk::Screen
    * Returns: screen
--- set_screen(screen)
    Same as Gdk::Event#screen=.  ((*Since 2.2*))
    * screen: a Gdk::Screen
    * Returns: self

== Constants
=== GdkEventType
Specifies the type of the event.
Do not confuse these events with the signals that GTK+ widgets emit. Although many of these events result in corresponding signals being emitted, the events are often transformed or filtered along the way. 
--- NOTHING
    a special code to indicate a null event.
--- DELETE
    the window manager has requested that the toplevel window be hidden or destroyed, usually when the user clicks on a special icon in the title bar.
--- DESTROY
    the window has been destroyed.
--- EXPOSE
    all or part of the window has become visible and needs to be redrawn.
--- MOTION_NOTIFY
    the pointer (usually a mouse) has moved.
--- BUTTON_PRESS
    a mouse button has been pressed.
--- BUTTON2_PRESS
    a mouse button has been double-clicked (clicked twice within a short period of time). Note that each click also generates a Gdk::Event::BUTTON_PRESS event.
--- BUTTON3_PRESS
    a mouse button has been clicked 3 times in a short period of time. Note that each click also generates a Gdk::Event::BUTTON_PRESS event.
--- BUTTON_RELEASE
    a mouse button has been released.
--- KEY_PRESS
    a key has been pressed.
--- KEY_RELEASE
    a key has been released.
--- ENTER_NOTIFY
    the pointer has entered the window.
--- LEAVE_NOTIFY
    the pointer has left the window.
--- FOCUS_CHANGE
    the keyboard focus has entered or left the window.
--- CONFIGURE
    the size, position or stacking order of the window has changed. Note that GTK+ discards these events for Gdk::Window::CHILD windows.
--- MAP
    the window has been mapped.
--- UNMAP
    the window has been unmapped.
--- PROPERTY_NOTIFY
    a property on the window has been changed or deleted.
--- SELECTION_CLEAR
    the application has lost ownership of a selection.
--- SELECTION_REQUEST
    another application has requested a selection.
--- SELECTION_NOTIFY
    a selection has been received.
--- PROXIMITY_IN
    an input device has moved into contact with a sensing surface (e.g. a touchscreen or graphics tablet).
--- PROXIMITY_OUT
    an input device has moved out of contact with a sensing surface.
--- DRAG_ENTER
    the mouse has entered the window while a drag is in progress.
--- DRAG_LEAVE
    the mouse has left the window while a drag is in progress.
--- DRAG_MOTION
    the mouse has moved in the window while a drag is in progress.
--- DRAG_STATUS
    the status of the drag operation initiated by the window has changed.
--- DROP_START
    a drop operation onto the window has started.
--- DROP_FINISHED
    the drop operation initiated by the window has completed.
--- CLIENT_EVENT
    a message has been received from another application.
--- VISIBILITY_NOTIFY
    the window visibility status has changed.
--- NO_EXPOSE
    indicates that the source region was completely available when parts of a drawable were copied. This is not very useful.
--- SCROLL
    Generated from button presses for the buttons 4 to 7. Wheel mice are usually configured to generate button press events for buttons 4 and 5 when the wheel is turned.
--- WINDOW_STATE
    Generated when the state of a toplevel window changes.
--- SETTING
    Generated when a setting is modified.
--- OWNER_CHANGE
    Generated when the owner of a selection changes. ((*Since 2.6*))
--- GRAB_BROKEN
    Generated when a pointer or keyboard grab is broken. ((*Since 2.8*))

=== GdkEventMask
A set of bit-flags to indicate which events a window is to receive. Most of these masks map onto one or more of the ((<GdkEventType|Gdk::Event#GdkEventType>)) event types above.
Gdk::Event::POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK is a special mask which is used to reduce the number of Gdk::Event::MOTION_NOTIFY events received. Normally a Gdk::Event::MOTION_NOTIFY event is received each time the mouse moves. However, if the application spends a lot of time processing the event (updating the display, for example), it can easily lag behind the position of the mouse. When using the Gdk::Event::POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK the server will only send a single Gdk::Event::MOTION_NOTIFY event (which is marked as a hint) until the application asks for more, by calling Gdk::Window#pointer.
 
--- EXPOSURE_MASK
--- POINTER_MOTION_MASK
--- POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK
--- BUTTON_MOTION_MASK
--- BUTTON1_MOTION_MASK
--- BUTTON2_MOTION_MASK
--- BUTTON3_MOTION_MASK
--- BUTTON_PRESS_MASK
--- BUTTON_RELEASE_MASK
--- KEY_PRESS_MASK
--- KEY_RELEASE_MASK
--- ENTER_NOTIFY_MASK
--- LEAVE_NOTIFY_MASK
--- FOCUS_CHANGE_MASK
--- STRUCTURE_MASK
--- PROPERTY_CHANGE_MASK
--- VISIBILITY_NOTIFY_MASK
--- PROXIMITY_IN_MASK
--- PROXIMITY_OUT_MASK
--- SUBSTRUCTURE_MASK
--- SCROLL_MASK
--- ALL_EVENTS_MASK
    the combination of all the above event masks.


=== Misc
--- CURRENT_TIME
    Represents the current time, and can be used anywhere a time is expected.
--- PRIORITY_EVENTS
    This is the priority that events from the X server are given in the GLib Main Loop.
--- PRIORITY_REDRAW
    This is the priority that the idle handler processing window updates is given in the GLib Main Loop
