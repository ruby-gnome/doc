== Class Methods

--- Gtk::TreeViewColumn.new(title = nil, cell_renderer = nil, attributes = nil)

    Creates a new Gtk::TreeViewColumn with a number of default values. 
    This is equivalent to calling Gtk::TreeViewColumn.new, Gtk::TreeViewColumn#title=, Gtk::TreeViewColumn#pack_start, and Gtk::TreeViewColumn#set_attributes on the newly created Gtk::TreeViewColumn.
    * title: The title to set the header to. 
    * cell_renderer: The Gtk::CellRenderer
    * attributes: a hash of attributes.
    * Returns : A newly created Gtk::TreeViewColumn.
       
    Here's a simple example:
 
     TEXT_COLUMN = 0
     COLOR_COLUMN = 1
 
     renderer = Gtk::CellRendererText.new
     column = Gtk::TreeViewColumn.new("Title", renderer, 
                                      :text => TEXT_COLUMN, 
                                      :foreground => COLOR_COLUMN)

== Instance Methods

--- pack_start(cell, expand)

    Packs the cell into the beginning of the column. If expand is false, then the cell is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is divided evenly between cells for which expand is true.
    * cell: The Gtk::CellRenderer.  
    * expand: true if cell is to be given extra space allocated to box.  
    * Returns: self

--- pack_end(cell, expand)

    Adds the cell to end of the column. If expand is false, then the cell is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is divided evenly between cells for which expand is true.
    * cell: The Gtk::CellRenderer.  
    * expand: true if cell is to be given extra space allocated to box.
    * Returns: self

--- clear

    Unsets all the mappings on all renderers on the Gtk::TreeViewColumn.
    * Returns: self

--- cell_renderers

    Returns an array of all the cell renderers in the column, in no particular order.
    * Returns: An array of Gtk::CellRenderer s

--- add_attribute(cell_renderer, attribute, column)

    Adds an attribute mapping to the list in the Gtk::TreeViewColumn. The column is the column of the model to get a value from, and the attribute is the parameter on cell_renderer to be set from the value. So for example if column 2 of the model contains strings, you could have the :text attribute of a Gtk::CellRendererText get its values from column 2.
    * cell_renderer: the Gtk::CellRenderer to set attributes on  
    * attribute: An attribute on the renderer(Symbol or String)
    * column: The column position on the model to get the attribute from.  
    * Returns: self

--- set_attributes(cell_renderer, attributes)

    Sets the attributes in the list as the attributes of the Gtk::TreeViewColumn. All existing attributes are removed, and replaced with the new attributes.
    You should set cell_renderer to the Gtk::TreeViewColumn before call this method.
    * cell_renderer: The Gtk::CellRenderer we're setting the attributes of
    * attributes: a hash of attributes. See Gtk::TreeViewColumn.new

--- set_cell_data_func(cell) {|tvc, cell, model, iter| ... }

    Sets the block which is used instead of the standard attributes mapping for setting the column value, and should set the value of Gtk::TreeViewColumn's cell renderer as appropriate.
    * cell: A Gtk::CellRenderer 
    * {|tvc, cell, model, iter| ... }: the block
       * tvc: the Gtk::TreeViewColumn
       * cell: the Gtk::CellRenderer
       * model: the Gtk::TreeModel
       * iter: the Gtk::TreeIter
    * Returns: self

--- clear_attributes(cell_renderer)

--- sort_column_id=(sort_column_id)

    Sets the logical sort_column_id that this column sorts on when this column is selected for sorting. Doing so makes the column header clickable.

    Changes the appearance of the sort indicator. 
    This does not actually sort the model. Use Gtk::TreeViewColumn#sort_column_id= if you want automatic sorting support. This method is primarily for custom sorting behavior, and should be used in conjunction with Gtk::TreeSortable#sort_column= to do that. For custom models, the mechanism will vary. 
    The sort indicator changes direction to indicate normal sort or reverse sort. Note that you must have the sort indicator enabled to see anything when calling this function; see Gtk::TreeViewColumn#sort_indicator=.
    * order: ((<GtkSortType|Gtk#GtkSortType>)) that the sort indicator should indicate 
    * Returns: order

--- set_sort_order(order)

    Same as Gtk::TreeViewColumn#sort_order=.
    * Returns: self

--- cell_set_cell_data(model,iter, is_expander, is_expanded)

    Sets the cell renderer based on the tree_model and iter. That is, for every attribute mapping in the Gtk::TreeViewColumn, it will get a value from the set column on the iter, and use that value to set the attribute on the cell renderer. This is used primarily by the Gtk::TreeView.
    * tree_model: The GtkTreeModel to to get the cell renderers attributes from. 
    * iter: The Gtk::TreeIter to to get the cell renderer's attributes from. 
    * is_expander: true, if the row has children

       * cell_area: An Gdk::Rectangle or nil
       * x_offset: x offset of cell relative to cell_area, or nil

       * height: height needed to render a cell, or nil

--- cell_is_visible?

    Returns true if any of the cells packed into the Gtk::TreeViewColumn are visible. For this to be meaningful, you must first initialize the cells with Gtk::TreeViewColumn#cell_set_cell_data.
    * Returns: true, if any of the cells packed into the Gtk::TreeViewColumn are currently visible

--- cell_data_func=

    not yet
    * Returns: self

    * Returns: self

--- expand

    Return true if the column expands to take any available space. ((*Since 2.4*))

--- expand=(expand)

    Sets the column to take available extra space. This space is shared equally amongst all columns that have the expand set to true. If no column has this option set, then the last column gets all extra space. By default, every column is created with this false. ((*Since 2.4*))
    * expand: the new value (true or false)

    Same as Gtk::TreeViewColumn#expand=(expand). ((*Since 2.4*))

    Gets the Column gets share of extra width allocated to the widget.
     * Returns: Column gets share of extra width allocated to the widget
