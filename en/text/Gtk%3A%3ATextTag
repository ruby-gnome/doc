= class Gtk::TextTag
You may wish to begin by reading ((<the text widget conceptual overview>)) which gives an overview of all the objects and data types related to the text widget and how they work together.

Tags should be in the Gtk::TextTagTable for a given Gtk::TextBuffer before using them with that buffer.

Gtk::TextBuffer#create_tag is the best way to create tags. See gtk-demo for numerous examples.

The "invisible" property was not implemented for GTK+ 2.0; it's planned to be implemented in future releases.

== Object Hierarchy
* Object
  * GLib::Instantiatable
    * GLib::Object
      * Gtk::TextTag

== Class Methods
--- Gtk::TextTag.new(name = nil)
    Creates a Gtk::TextTag. Configure the tag using object arguments, 
    * name: tag name, or nil 
    * Returns: a new Gtk::TextTag 


== Instance Methods
--- priority
    Get the tag priority.
    * Returns: The tag's priority. 
--- priority=(priority)
    Sets the priority of a Gtk::TextTag. Valid priorities are start at 0 and go to one less than Gtk::TextTagTable#size. Each tag in a table has a unique priority; setting the priority of one tag shifts the priorities of all the other tags in the table to maintain a unique priority for each tag. Higher priority tags "win" if two tags both set the same text attribute. When adding a tag to a tag table, it will be assigned the highest priority in the table by default; so normally the precedence of a set of tags is the order in which they were added to the table, or created with Gtk::TextBuffer#create_tag, which adds the tag to the buffer's table automatically.
