== Class Methods
--- Gtk::TreeModelSort.new(child_model)
    Creates a new Gtk::TreeModel, with child_model as the child_model.
    * child_model: A Gtk::TreeModel 
    * Returns: A new Gtk::TreeModel. 

== Instance Methods
--- model
    Returns the model the Gtk::TreeModelSort is sorting.
    * Returns: the "child model" being sorted 
--- model=(child_model)
    Sets the model of the Gtk::TreeModelSort to be child_model.  If child_model is nil, then the old model is unset.  The sort method is unset as a result of this call. This method is for construct time only.
    The model will be in an unsorted state until a sort method is set.
    * child_model: A Gtk::TreeModel, or nil.
    * Returns: model
--- set_model(child_model)
    Same as Gtk::TreeModelSort#model=.
    * child_model: A Gtk::TreeModel, or nil.
    * Returns: self

--- convert_child_path_to_path(child_path)
    Converts child_path to a path relative to the Gtk::TreeModelSort. That is, child_path points to a path in the child model. The returned path will point to the same row in the sorted model. If child_path isn't a valid path on the child model, then nil is returned.
    * child_path: A Gtk::TreePath to convert 
    * Returns: A newly allocated Gtk::TreePath, or nil 

--- convert_child_iter_to_iter(child_iter)
    Gets a Gtk::TreeIter which point to the row in the Gtk::TreeModelSort that corresponds to the row pointed at by child_iter.
    * child_iter: A valid Gtk::TreeIter pointing to a row on the child model 
    * Returns: A Gtk::TreeIter. 

--- convert_path_to_child_path(sorted_path)
    Converts sorted_path to a path on the child model of the Gtk::TreeModelSort. That is, sorted_path points to a location in the Gtk::TreeModelSort. The returned path will point to the same location in the model not being sorted. If sorted_path does not point to a location in the child model, nil is returned.
    * sorted_path: A Gtk::TreePath to convert 
    * Returns: A newly allocated Gtk::TreePath, or nil

--- convert_iter_to_child_iter(sorted_iter)
    Gets a Gtk::TreeIter which point to the row pointed to by sorted_iter.
    * sorted_iter: A valid Gtk::TreeIter pointing to a row on the Gtk::TreeModelSort. 
    * Returns: A Gtk::TreeIter 

--- reset_default_sort_func
    This resets the default sort function to be in the 'unsorted' state. That is, it is in the same order as the child model. It will re-sort the model to be in the same order as the child model only if the Gtk::TreeModelSort is in 'unsorted' state.
    * Returns: self

--- clear_cache
    This method should almost never be called. It clears the Gtk::TreeModelSort of any cached iterators that haven't been reffed by GTK+. This might be useful if the child model being sorted is static (and doesn't change often) and there has been a lot of unreffed access to nodes. As a side effect of this method, all unreffed iters will be invalid.
    * Returns: self

== Properties
--- model: Gtk::TreeModel (Read/Write)
    The model for the TreeModelSort to sort
