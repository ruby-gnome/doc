= class Gtk::Toolbar

Gtk::Toolbar is a bar of buttons and other widgets.

A toolbar is created with a call to Gtk::Toolbar.new.

Any of Gtk::ToggleButton, Gtk::RadioButton, or an arbitrary widget can be added to the toolbar with Gtk::Toolbar#append, Gtk::Toolbar#prepend, and Gtk::Toolbar#insert.

Widgets can be visibly grouped by adding gaps between widgets using Gtk::Toolbar#append_space, Gtk::Toolbar#prepend_space, and Gtk::Toolbar#insert_space.

The append, prepend, and insert methods that have a tooltip parameters are deprecated since Gtk 2.4.  Try using with the parameters before the first tooltip parameter.  For example, insert(position, widget) works.
