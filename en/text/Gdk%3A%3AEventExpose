== Class Methods
--- Gdk::EventExpose.new(type = Gdk::EventExpose)
    Creates a new event of the given type. All fields are set to 0. ((* Since 2.2 *))
    * type: Gdk::Event::EXPOSE.
    * Returns: a new Gdk::EventExpose.

--- Gdk::EventExpose.get_graphics_expose(window)
    Waits for a GraphicsExpose or NoExpose event from the X server.
    * window: the Gdk::Window to wait for the events for
    * Returns: a Gdk::EventExpose if a GraphicsExpose was received, or nil if a NoExpose event was received

== Instance Methods
--- area
    Gets the bounding box of region. 
    * Returns: the bounding box of region(Gdk::Rectangle)
--- area=(rect)
    Sets the bounding box of retion.
    * rect: the bounding box of region(Gdk::Rectangle)
    * Returns: rect
--- set_area(rect)
    Same as Gdk::EventExpose#area=.
    * rect: the bounding box of region(Gdk::Rectangle)
    * Returns: self

--- region
    Gets the region that needs to be redrawn.
    * Returns: the Gdk::Region that needs to be redrawn
--- region=(region)
    Sets the region that needs to be redrawn. 
    * region: the Gdk::Region that needs to be redrawn
    * Returns: region
--- set_region(region)
    Same as Gdk::EventExpose#region=.
    * region: the Gdk::Region that needs to be redrawn
    * Returns: self

--- count
    Gets the number of contiguous Gdk::Event::EXPOSE events following this one. The only use for this is "exposure compression", i.e. handling all contiguous Gdk::Event::EXPOSE events in one go, though GDK performs some exposure compression so this is not normally needed. 
    * Returns: the number of contiguous Gdk::Event::EXPOSE events following this one.
