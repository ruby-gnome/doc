== Class Methods

--- Gtk::Widget.default_colormap

    Obtains the default colormap used to create widgets.
    * Returns: default widget colormap

--- Gtk::Widget.set_default_colormap(colormap)

    Sets the default colormap to use when creating widgets. Gtk::Widget.push_colormap is a better method to use if you only want to affect a few widgets, rather than all widgets.
    * colormap: a Gdk::Colormap 
    * Returns: colormap

--- Gtk::Widget.default_direction

    Obtains the current default reading direction. See Gtk::Widget.set_default_direction.
    * Returns: the current default direction.

--- Gtk::Widget.set_default_direction(direction)

    Sets the default reading direction for widgets where the direction has not been explicitly set by Gtk::Widget.set_direction.
    * dir: the new default direction(((<GtkTextDirection|URL:#GtkTextDirection>)). This cannot be Gtk::Widget::TEXT_DIR_NONE. 
    * Returns: dir

--- Gtk::Widget.default_style

    Returns the default style used by all widgets initially.
    * Returns: the default style. This Gtk::Style object is owned by GTK+ and should not be modified or freed.

--- Gtk::Widget.default_visual

    Obtains the visual of the default colormap. Not really useful; used to be useful before Gdk::Colormap#visual existed.

    * Returns: visual of the default colormap

--- Gtk::Widget.push_colormap(cmap)

    Pushes cmap onto a global stack of colormaps; the topmost colormap on the stack will be used to create all widgets. Remove cmap with Gtk::Widget.pop_colormap. There's little reason to use this method.
    * cmap: a Gdk::Colormap
    * Returns: cmap

--- Gtk::Widget.pop_colormap

    Removes a colormap pushed with Gtk::Widget.push_colormap.
    * Returns: self

--- Gtk::Widget.push_composite_child

    Makes all newly-created widgets as composite children until the corresponding Gtk::Widget.pop_composite_child call.
    A composite child is a child that's an implementation detail of the container it's inside and should not be visible to people using the container. Composite children aren't treated differently by GTK, but e.g. GUI builders might want to treat them in a different way.
    * Returns: self

--- Gtk::Widget.pop_composite_child

    Cancels the effect of a previous call to Gtk::Widget.push_composite_child.
    * Returns: self

--- Gtk::Widget.install_style_property(pspec)

    Install style property to the class.
    * pspec: a subclass of GLib::Param
    * Returns: self

--- Gtk::Widget.install_style_property(pspec) {|pspec, str| ... val}

    Install style property to the class and use the block for parsing the resource information from a string.
    * pspec: a subclass of GLib::Param.
    * {|pspec, str| ... val}: a block which parses the resource information from a string and returns it.
    * Returns: self

--- Gtk::Widget.style_properties(inherited_too = true)

    Gets the style property names. ((* Since 2.2 *))
    * inherited_too: true if you get all of the names, false if you get the names which defined by this class.
    * Returns: an array of style property names.

--- Gtk::Widget.style_property(prop_name)

    Gets the style property. ((* Since 2.2 *))
    * prop_name: the property name.
    * Returns: the style property.

--- Gtk::Widget.default_colormap=

     * Returns: self: ((*FIXME*))

--- Gtk::Widget.default_direction=

     * Returns: self: ((*FIXME*))

== Instance Methods

--- flags

    Returns the widget flags.
    * Returns: the flags (((<GtkWidgetFlags|Gtk::Widget#GtkWidgetFlags>)))

--- flags=(flags)

    Turns on certain widget flags.
    * flag: the flags to set (((<GtkWidgetFlags|Gtk::Widget#GtkWidgetFlags>)))
    * Returns: flags

--- set_flags(flags)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#flags=.
    * flag: the flags to set (((<GtkWidgetFlags|Gtk::Widget#GtkWidgetFlags>)))
    * Returns: self

--- unset_flags(flags)

    Turns off certain widget flags.
    * flag: the flags to unset (((<GtkWidgetFlags|Gtk::Widget#GtkWidgetFlags>)))
    * Returns: self

--- unparent

    This method is only for use in widget implementations. Should be called by implementations of the remove method on Gtk::Container, to dissociate a child from the container.
    * Returns: self

--- show

    Flags a widget to be displayed. Any widget that isn't shown will not appear on the screen. If you want to show all the widgets in a container, it's easier to call Gtk::Widget#show_all on the container, instead of individually showing the widgets.
    Remember that you have to show the containers containing a widget, in addition to the widget itself, before it will appear onscreen.
    When a toplevel container is shown, it is immediately realized and mapped; other shown widgets are realized and mapped when their toplevel container is realized and mapped.
    * Returns: self

--- show_now

    Shows a widget. If the widget is an unmapped toplevel widget (i.e. a Gtk::Window that has not yet been shown), enter the main loop and wait for the window to actually be mapped. Be careful; because the main loop is running, anything can happen during this method.
    * Returns: self

--- hide

    Reverses the effects of Gtk::Widget#show, causing the widget to be hidden(invisible to the user).
    * Returns: self

--- show_all

    Recursively shows a widget, and any child widgets (if the widget is a container).
    * Returns: self

--- hide_all

    Recursively hides a widget and any child widgets.
    * Returns: self

--- map

    This method is only for use in widget implementations. Causes a widget to be mapped if it isn't already.
    * Returns: self

--- unmap

    This method is only for use in widget implementations. Causes a widget to be unmapped if it's currently mapped.
    * Returns: self

--- realize

    Creates the GDK (windowing system) resources associated with a widget. For example, Gtk::Widget#window will be created when a widget is realized. Normally realization happens implicitly; if you show a widget and all its parent containers, then the widget will be realized and mapped automatically.
    Realizing a widget requires all the widget's parent widgets to be realized; calling Gtk::Widget#realize realizes the widget's parents in addition to widget itself. If a widget is not yet inside a toplevel window when you realize it, bad things will happen.
    This method is primarily used in widget implementations, and isn't very useful otherwise. Many times when you think you might need it, a better approach is to connect to a signal that will be called after the widget is realized automatically, such as "expose_event". Or simply GLib::Instantiatable#signal_connect_after to the "realize" signal.
    * Returns: self

--- unrealize

    This method is only useful in widget implementations. Causes a widget to be unrealized (frees all GDK resources associated with the widget, such as Gtk::Widget#window).
    * Returns: self

--- queue_draw

    Equivalent to calling Gtk::Widget#queue_draw_area for the entire area of a widget.
    * Returns: self

--- queue_resize

    This method is only for use in widget implementations. Flags a widget to have its size renegotiated; should be called when a widget for some reason has a new size request. For example, when you change the text in a Gtk::Label, Gtk::Label queues a resize to ensure there's enough space for the new text.
    * Returns: self

--- queue_resize_no_redraw

    This function works like #queue_resize, except that the widget is not invalidated. ((*Since 2.4*))
    * Returns: self

--- size_request

    This method is typically used when implementing a Gtk::Container subclass. Obtains the preferred size of a widget. The container uses this information to arrange its child widgets and decide what size allocations to give them with Gtk::Widget#size_allocate().
    You can also call this method from an application, with some caveats. Most notably, getting a size request requires the widget to be associated with a screen, because font information may be needed. Multihead-aware applications should keep this in mind.
    Also remember that the size request is not necessarily the size a widget will actually be allocated.
    See also Gtk::Widget#child_requisition.
    
    (((*Notice*))):This method name is special in Ruby-GNOME2. This method is not reverses the effects of Gtk::Widget#set_size_request. If you need that purpose, use Gtk::Widget#get_size_request instead.
    * Returns: a [width, height]

--- get_size_request

    Gets the size request that was explicitly set for the widget using Gtk::Widget#set_size_request. A value of -1 stored in width or height indicates that that dimension has not been set explicitly and the natural requisition of the widget will be used intead. See Gtk::Widget#set_size_request. To get the size a widget will actually use, call Gtk::Widget#size_request instead of this method.
    
    (((*Notice*))):This method name is special in Ruby-GNOME2. Usually we should name this as Gtk::Widget#size_request.
    But there has been Gtk::Widget#size_request as another method already. So we named this method same as original GTK+ name.
    * Returns: [width, height]

--- set_size_request(width, height)

    Sets the minimum size of a widget; that is, the widget's size request will be width by height. You can use this method to force a widget to be either larger or smaller than it normally would be.
    In most cases, Gtk::Window#set_default_size is a better choice for toplevel windows than this method; setting the default size will still allow users to shrink the window. Setting the size request will force them to leave the window at least as large as the size request. When dealing with window sizes, Gtk::Window#set_geometry_hints can be a useful method as well.
    Note the inherent danger of setting any fixed size - themes, translations into other languages, different fonts, and user action can all change the appropriate size for a given widget. So, it's basically impossible to hardcode a size that will always be correct.
    The size request of a widget is the smallest size a widget can accept while still functioning well and drawing itself correctly. However in some strange cases a widget may be allocated less than its requested size, and in many cases a widget may be allocated more space than it requested.
    If the size request in a given direction is -1 (unset), then the "natural" size request of the widget will be used instead.
    Widgets can't actually be allocated a size less than 1 by 1, but you can pass 0,0 to this method to mean "as small as possible."
    * width: width widget should request, or -1 to unset 
    * height: height widget should request, or -1 to unset 
    * Returns: self

--- width_request

    Returns the width request of the widget
    * Returns: width widget should request, or -1 to unset

--- width_request=(width)

    Override for width request of the widget, or -1 if natural request should be used.
    * width: width widget should request, or -1 to unset 
    * Returns: width

--- set_width_request(width)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#width_request=.
    * width: width widget should request, or -1 to unset 
    * Returns: self

--- height_request

    Returns the height request of the widget
    * Returns: height widget should request, or -1 to unset

--- height_request=(height)

    Override for height request of the widget, or -1 if natural request should be used.
    * height: height widget should request, or -1 to unset 
    * Returns: height

--- set_height_request(height)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#height_request=.
    * height: height widget should request, or -1 to unset 
    * Returns: self

--- child_requisition

    This method is only for use in widget implementations. Obtains widget.requisition, unless someone has forced a particular geometry on the widget (e.g. with Gtk::Widget#set_usize), in which case it returns that geometry instead of the widget's requisition.
    This method differs from Gtk::Widget#size_request in that it retrieves the last size request value from widget.requisition, while Gtk::Widget#size_request actually calls the "size_request" method on widget to compute the size request and fill in widget.requisition, and only then returns widget.requisition.
    Because this method does not call the "size_request" method, it can only be used when you know that widget.requisition is up-to-date, that is, Gtk::Widget#size_request has been called since the last time a resize was queued. In general, only container implementations have this information; applications should use Gtk::Widget#size_request.
    * Returns: a [width, height]

--- size_allocate(allocation)

    This function is only used by Gtk::Container subclasses, to assign a size and position to their child widgets.
    * allocation: position and size to be allocated to widget
    * Returns: self

--- add_accelerator(accel_signal, accel_group, accel_key, accel_mods, accel_flags)

    Installs an accelerator for this widget in accel_group that causes accel_signal to be emitted if the accelerator is activated. The accel_group needs to be added to the widget's toplevel via Gtk::Window#add_accel_group, and the signal must be of type G_RUN_ACTION(not implemented yet). Accelerators added through this function are not user changeable during runtime. If you want to support accelerators that can be changed by the user, use Gtk::AccelMap#add_entry and Gtk::Widget#set_accel_path or Gtk::MenuItem#accel_path= instead.
    * accel_signal: widget signal to emit on accelerator activation (String) 
    * accel_group: a Gtk::AccelGroup for this widget, added to its toplevel 
    * accel_key: GDK keyval of the accelerator(Gdk::Keyval)
    * accel_mods: modifier key combination of the accelerator(((<GdkModifierType|Gdk::Window#GdkModifierType>)))
    * accel_flags: flag accelerators(((<GtkAccelFlags|Gtk#GtkAccelFlags>))), e.g. Gtk::ACCEL_VISIBLE
    * Returns: self

--- remove_accelerator(accel_group, accel_key, accel_mods)

    Removes an accelerator from widget, previously installed with Gtk::Widget#add_accelerator.
    * accel_group: a Gtk::AccelGroup for this widget 
    * accel_key: GDK keyval of the accelerator (Gdk::Keyval)
    * accel_mods: modifier key combination of the accelerator (((<GdkModifierType|Gdk::Window#GdkModifierType>)))
    * Returns: true if an accelerator was installed and could be removed

--- set_accel_path(accel_path, accel_group)

    Given an accelerator group, accel_group, and an accelerator path, accel_path, sets up an accelerator in accel_group so whenever the key binding that is defined for accel_path is pressed, widget will be activated. This removes any accelerators (for any accelerator group) installed by previous calls to Gtk::Widget#set_accel_path. Associating accelerators with paths allows them to be modified by the user and the modifications to be saved for future use. (See Gtk::AccelMap#save.)
    This function is a low level function that would most likely be used by a menu creation system like Gtk::ItemFactory. If you use Gtk::ItemFactory, setting up accelerator paths will be done automatically.
    Even when you you aren't using Gtk::ItemFactory, if you only want to set up accelerators on menu items Gtk::MenuItem#accel_path= provides a somewhat more convenient interface.
    * accel_path : path used to look up the the accelerator (String)
    * accel_group : a Gtk::AccelGroup. 
    * Returns: self

--- accel_closures

    Lists the closures used by widget for accelerator group connections with Gtk::AccelGroup#connect(). The closures can be used to monitor accelerator changes on widget, by connecting to the ::accel_changed signal of the Gtk::AccelGroup of a closure which can be found out with Gtk::AccelGroup.from_accel_closure().
    * Returns : an array of closures(GLib::Closure)

--- can_activate_accel?(signal_id)

    Determines whether an accelerator that activates the signal identified by signal_id can currently be activated. This is done by emitting the Gtk::Widget#can-activate-accel signal on self; if the signal isn't overridden by a handler or in a derived widget, then the default check is that the widget must be sensitive, and the widget and all its ancestors mapped. ((*Since 2.4*))
    * signal_id: the ID of a signal installed on widget (Fixnum)
    * Returns: true if the accelerator can be activated.

--- event(event)

    Rarely-used method. This method is used to emit the event signals on a widget (those signals should never be emitted without using this method to do so). If you want to synthesize an event though, don't use this method; instead, use Gtk.main_do_event so the event will behave as if it were in the event queue. Don't synthesize expose events; instead, use Gdk::Window#invalidate to invalidate a region of the window.
    * event: a Gdk::Event 
    * Returns: return from the event signal emission (true if the event was handled)

--- activate

    For widgets that can be "activated" (buttons, menu items, etc.) this method activates them. Activation is what happens when you press Enter on a widget during key navigation; clicking a button, selecting a menu item, etc. If widget isn't activatable, the method returns false.
    * Returns: true if the widget was activatable

--- reparent(new_parent)

    Moves a widget from one Gtk::Container to another, handling reference count issues to avoid destroying the widget.
    * new_parent : a Gtk::Container to move the widget into

--- intersect(area, intersection)

    Computes the intersection of a widget's area and area, storing the intersection in intersection, and returns true if there was an intersection. intersection may be null if you're only interested in whether there was an intersection.
    * area: a Gdk::Rectangle 
    * Returns: a Gdk::Rectangle which is intersection of widget and area or Qnil

--- focus?

    Determines if the widget is the focus widget within its toplevel. (This does not mean that the Gtk::Widget#has_focus= is necessarily set true; Gtk::Widget#has_focus will only be set if the toplevel widget additionally has the global input focus.)
    * Returns: true if the widget is the focus widget.

--- grab_focus

    Causes widget to have the keyboard focus for the Gtk::Window it's inside. widget must be a focusable widget, such as a Gtk::Entry; something like Gtk::Frame won't work. (More precisely, it must have the Gtk::Widget#can_focus= set true.)
    Returns: self

--- grab_default

    Causes widget to become the default widget. widget must have the Gtk::Widget#can_default? flag set true; typically you have to set this flag yourself by calling Gtk::Widget#can_default=. The default widget is activated when the user presses Enter in a window. Default widgets must be activatable, that is, Gtk::Widget#activate should affect them.

--- name

    Retrieves the name of a widget. See Gtk::Widget#name= for the significance of widget names.
    * Returns: name of the widget

--- name=(name)

    Widgets can be named, which allows you to refer to them from a gtkrc file. You can apply a style to widgets with a particular name in the gtkrc file. See the documentation for gtkrc files (on the same page as the docs for Gtk::RcStyle).
    * name: name for the widget 
    * Returns: name

--- set_name(name)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#name=.
    * name: name for the widget 
    * Returns: self

--- state

    Retrieves the state of a widget. See Gtk::Widget#state= for the significance of widget states.
    * Returns: state of the widget (((<GtkStateType|Gtk#GtkStateType>)))

--- state=(state)

    This method is for use in widget implementations. Sets the state of a widget (insensitive, prelighted, etc.) Usually you should set the state using wrapper methods such as Gtk::Widget#sensitive=.
    * state : new state for widget(((<GtkStateType|Gtk#GtkStateType>)))
    * Returns: state

--- set_state(state)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#state=.
    * state : new state for widget
    * Returns: state

--- sensitive?

    Retrieves the senstivity of a widget. See Gtk::Widget#sensitive= for the significance of widget sensitives. This method is wrapper of "sensitive" property of Gtk::Widget.
    * Returns: true if the widget is sensitive.

--- sensitive=(sensitive)

    Sets the sensitivity of a widget. A widget is sensitive if the user can interact with it. Insensitive widgets are "grayed out" and the user can't interact with them. Insensitive widgets are known as "inactive", "disabled", or "ghosted" in some other toolkits.
    * sensitive: true to make the widget sensitive 
    * Returns: sensitive

--- set_sensitive(sensitive)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#sensitive=.
    * sensitive: true to make the widget sensitive 
    * Returns: self

--- parent_sensitive?

    Gets the value whether the Gtk::Widget::PARENT_SENSITIVE flag has be set on the widget.
    * Returns: true if the Gtk::Widget::PARENT_SENSITIVE flag has be set on the widget

--- sensitive_with_parent?

    Gets the value whether the widget and the parent are sensitive. This method is equivalent to Gtk::Widget#sensitive? and Gtk::Widget#parent_sensitive?. And this method is wrapper of GTK_WIDGET_IS_SENSITIVE.
    * Returns: true if the widget and the parent are sensitive.

--- parent

    Retrieves the parent widget of this widget. 
    * Returns: a Gtk::Container widget

--- parent=(parent)

    This method is useful only when implementing subclasses of Gtk::Container. Sets the container as the parent of widget, and takes care of some details such as updating the state and style of the child to reflect its new location. The opposite function is Gtk::Widget#unparent.
    * parent: parent container 
    * Returns: parent

--- set_parent(parent)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#parent=.
    * parent: parent container 
    * Returns: self

--- parent_window

    Gets widget's parent window.
    * Returns: the parent window of widget(Gdk::Window).

--- parent_window=(parent_window)

    Sets a non default parent window for widget.
    * parent_window: the new parent window(Gdk::Window) 
    * Returns: parent_window

--- set_parent_window(parent_window)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#parent_window=.
    * parent_window: the new parent window(Gdk::Window) 
    * Returns: self

--- events

    Returns the event mask for the widget (a bitfield containing flags from the ((<GdkEventMask|Gdk::Event#GdkEventMask>)) enumeration). These are the events that the widget will receive.
    * Returns : event mask for widget (((<GdkEventMask|Gdk::Event#GdkEventMask>)))

--- events=(events)

    Sets the event mask (see ((<GdkEventMask|Gdk::Event#GdkEventMask>))) for a widget. The event mask determines which events a widget will receive. Keep in mind that different widgets have different default event masks, and by changing the event mask you may disrupt a widget's functionality, so be careful. This function must be called while a widget is unrealized. Consider Gtk::Widget#add_events for widgets that are already realized, or if you want to preserve the existing event mask. This method can't be used with Gtk::Widget::NO_WINDOW widgets; to get events on those widgets, place them inside a Gtk::EventBox and receive events on the event box.
    * events: event mask (((<GdkEventMask|Gdk::Event#GdkEventMask>)))
    * Returns: events

--- set_events(events)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#events=.
    * events: event mask (((<GdkEventMask|Gdk::Event#GdkEventMask>)))
    * Returns: self

--- add_events(events)

    Adds the events in the bitfield events to the event mask for widget. See Gtk::Widget#set_events for details.
    * events: an event mask, see ((<GdkEventMask|Gdk::Event#GdkEventMask>)) 
    * Returns: self

--- extension_events

    Retrieves the extension events the widget will receive; see Gdk::Input.set_extension_events.
    * Returns: extension events for widget

--- extension_events=(mode)

    Sets the extension events mask to mode. See ((<GdkExtensionMode|Gdk::Input#GdkExtensionMode>)) and Gdk::Input.set_extension_events.
    * mode: bitfield of extension events to receive (((<GdkExtensionMode|Gdk::Input#GdkExtensionMode>)))
    * Returns: mode

--- set_extension_events(mode)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#extension_events=.
    * mode: bitfield of extension events to receive (((<GdkExtensionMode|Gdk::Input#GdkExtensionMode>)))
    * Returns: self

--- toplevel

    This method returns the topmost widget in the container hierarchy widget is a part of. If widget has no parent widgets, it will be returned as the topmost widget. No reference will be added to the returned widget; it should not be unreferenced.
    Note the difference in behavior vs. Gtk::Widget#get_ancestor(Gtk::Window) would return nil if widget wasn't inside a toplevel window, and if the window was inside a Gtk::Window-derived widget which was in turn inside the toplevel Gtk::Window. While the second case may seem unlikely, it actually happens when a Gtk::Plug is embedded inside a Gtk::Socket within the same application.
    To reliably find the toplevel Gtk::Window, use Gtk::Widget#toplevel and check Gtk::Widget#toplevel?     
     topwidget = button.toplevel
       if topwidget.toplevel?
       [ Perform action on toplevel. ]
     end 
     
     
    * Returns: the topmost ancestor of widget, or widget itself if there's no ancestor.

--- toplevel?

    Evaluates to true if the widget is a toplevel widget.
    * Returns: true if the widget is a toplevel widget.

--- ancestor?(ancestor)

    Determines whether widget is somewhere inside ancestor, possibly with intermediate containers.
    * ancestor: another GtkWidget 
    * Returns: true if ancestor contains widget as a child, grandchild, great grandchild, etc.

--- get_ancestor(widget_class)

    Gets the first ancestor of widget with class widget_class. For example, Gtk::Widget#get_ancestor(Gtk::Box) gets the first Gtk::Box that's an ancestor of widget. No reference will be added to the returned widget; it should not be unreferenced. See note about checking for a toplevel Gtk::Window in the docs for Gtk::Widget#toplevel.
    * widget_class: ancestor class 
    * Returns: the ancestor widget, or nil if not found

--- colormap

    Gets the colormap that will be used to render widget. No reference will be added to the returned colormap; it should not be unreferenced.
    * Returns: the Gdk::Colormap used by widget

--- colormap=(colormap)

    Sets the colormap for the widget to the given value. Widget must not have been previously realized.
    * colormap: a Gdk::Colormap
    * Returns: colormap

--- set_colormap(colormap)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#colormap=.
    * colormap: a Gdk::Colormap
    * Returns: self

--- visual

    Gets the visual that will be used to render widget.
    * Returns: the Gdk::Visual for widget

--- pointer

    Obtains the location of the mouse pointer in widget coordinates. Widget coordinates are a bit odd; for historical reasons, they are defined as widget.window coordinates for widgets that are not Gtk::Widget::NO_WINDOW widgets, and are relative to widget.allocation.x, widget.allocation.y for widgets that are Gtk::Widget::NO_WINDOW widgets.
    * Returns: [x, y]
       * x: the X coordinate
       * y: the Y coordinate

--- translate_coordinates(dest_widget, src_x, src_y)

    Translate coordinates relative to self's allocation to coordinates relative to dest_widget's allocations. In order to perform this operation, both widgets must be realized, and must share a common toplevel.
    * dest_widget: a Gtk::Widget 
    * src_x : X position relative to self
    * src_y : Y position relative to self
    * Returns : Qnil if either widget was not realized, or there was no common ancestor. Otherwise [dest_x, dest_y] 
       * dest_x : location to store X position relative to dest_widget 
       * dest_y : location to store Y position relative to dest_widget

--- hide_on_delete

    Utility method; intended to be connected to the "delete_event" signal on a Gtk::Window. The function calls Gtk::Widget#hide on its argument, then returns true. If connected to "delete_event", the result is that clicking the close button for a window (on the window frame, top right corner usually) will hide but not destroy the window. By default, GTK+ destroys windows when "delete_event" is received.
     * Returns: true

--- style

    Retrieves the style; see Gtk::Widget#style=.
    * Returns: the widget's Gtk::Style

--- style=(style)

    Sets the Gtk::Style for a widget. You probably don't want to use this method; it interacts badly with themes, because themes work by replacing the Gtk::Style. Instead, use Gtk::Widget#modify_style.
    * style: a Gtk::Style, or nil to remove the effect of a previous Gtk::Widget#style= and go back to the default style 
    * Returns: style

--- set_style(style)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#style=.
    * style: a Gtk::Style, or nil to remove the effect of a previous Gtk::Widget#style= and go back to the default style 
    * Returns: self

--- reset_rc_styles

    Reset the styles of widget and all descendents, so when they are looked up again, they get the correct values for the currently loaded RC file settings. 
    This method is not useful for applications.

--- direction

    Gets the reading direction for a particular widget. See Gtk::Widget#direction=.
    * Returns: the reading direction for the widget.

--- direction=(dir)

    Sets the reading direction on a particular widget. This direction controls the primary direction for widgets containing text, and also the direction in which the children of a container are packed. The ability to set the direction is present in order so that correct localization into languages with right-to-left reading directions can be done. Generally, applications will let the default reading direction present, except for containers where the containers are arranged in an order that is explicitely visual rather than logical (such as buttons for text justification).
    If the direction is set to Gtk::Widget::TEXT_DIR_NONE, then the value set by Gtk::Widget.set_default_direction will be used.
    * dir: the new default direction(((<GtkTextDirection|URL:#GtkTextDirection>)). 
    * Returns: dir

--- set_direction(dir)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#direction=.
    * dir: the new default direction(((<GtkTextDirection|URL:#GtkTextDirection>)). 
    * Returns: self

--- shape_combine_mask(shape_mask, offset_x, offset_y)

    Sets a shape for this widget's GDK window. This allows for transparent windows etc., see Gdk::Window#shape_combine_mask for more information.
    * shape_mask: Gdk::Pixmap(depth=1) to be added, or nil to remove an existing shape.  
    * offset_x: X position of shape mask with respect to window. 
    * offset_y: Y position of shape mask with respect to window. 
    * Returns: self

--- input_shape_combine_mask(shape_mask, offset_x, offset_y)

    Sets an input shape for this widget's GDK window. This allows for windows which react to mouse click in a nonrectangular region, see Gdk::Window#input_shape_combine_mask for more information. ((*Since 2.10*))
    * shape_mask: shape to be added, or nil to remove an existing shape.
    * offset_x: X position of shape mask with respect to window.
    * offset_y: Y position of shape mask with respect to window.
    * Returns: self

--- path

    Obtains the full path to widget. The path is simply the name of a widget and all its parents in the container hierarchy, separated by periods. The name of a widget comes from Gtk::Widget#name. Paths are used to apply styles to a widget in gtkrc configuration files. Widget names are the type of the widget by default (e.g. "Gtk::Button") or can be set to an application-specific value with Gtk::Widget#name=. By setting the name of a widget, you allow users or theme authors to apply styles to that specific widget in their gtkrc file. path_reversed fills in the path in reverse order, i.e. starting with widget's name instead of starting with the name of widget's outermost ancestor.
    * Returns: [path, path_reversed]
       * path: path string, or nil  
       * path_reversed: reverse path string, or nil

--- class_path

    Same as Gtk::Widget#path, but always uses the name of a widget's type, never uses a custom name set with Gtk::Widget#name=.
    * path: the class path, or nil 
    * path_reversed: the reverse class path, or nil

--- composite_name

    Obtains the composite name of a widget.
    * Returns: the composite name of widget, or nil if widget is not a composite child. The string should not be freed when it is no longer needed.

--- composite_name=(name)

    Sets a widgets composite name. The widget must be a composite child of its parent; see Gtk::Widget#push_composite_child.
    * name: the name to set. 
    * Returns: name

--- set_composite_name(name)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#composite_name=
    * name: the name to set. 
    * Returns: self

--- modify_style(style)

    Modifies style values on the widget. Modifications made using this technique take precedence over style values set via an RC file, however, they will be overriden if a style is explicitely set on the widget using Gtk::Widget#set_style. The Gtk::RcStyle structure is designed so each field can either be set or unset, so it is possible, using this function, to modify some style values and leave the others unchanged.
    Note that modifications made with this function are not cumulative with previous calls to Gtk::Widget#modify_style or with such functions as Gtk::Widget#modify_fg. If you wish to retain previous values, you must first call Gtk::Widget#modifier_style(), make your modifications to the returned style, then call Gtk::Widget#modify_style with that style. On the other hand, if you first call Gtk::Widget#modify_style, subsequent calls to such functions Gtk::Widget#modify_fg will have a cumulative effect with the initial modifications.
    * style: the Gtk::RcStyle holding the style modifications 
    * Returns: self

--- modifier_style

    Returns the current modifier style for the widget. (As set by Gtk::Widget#modify_style.) If no style has previously set, a new Gtk::RcStyle will be created with all values unset, and set as the modifier style for the widget. If you make changes to this rc style, you must call Gtk::Widget#modify_style, passing in the returned rc style, to make sure that your changes take effect.
    ((*Caution:*)) passing the style back to Gtk::Widget#modify_style will normally end up destroying it, because Gtk::Widget#modify_style copies the passed-in style and sets the copy as the new modifier style, thus dropping any reference to the old modifier style. Add a reference to the modifier style if you want to keep it alive.
    * Returns: the modifier style(Gtk::RcStyle) for the widget. This rc style is owned by the widget.

--- modify_fg(state, color)

    Sets the foreground color for a widget in a particular state. All other style values are left untouched. See also Gtk::Widget#modify_style.
    * state: the state(((<GtkStateType|Gtk#GtkStateType>))) for which to set the foreground color. 
    * color: the Gdk::Color to assign (does not need to be allocated). 
    * Returns: self

--- modify_bg(state, color)

    Sets the background color for a widget in a particular state. All other style values are left untouched. See also Gtk::Widget#modify_style.
    * state: the state(((<GtkStateType|Gtk#GtkStateType>))) for which to set the background color. 
    * color: the Gdk::Color to assign (does not need to be allocated). 
    * Returns: self

--- modify_text(state, color)

    Sets the text color for a widget in a particular state. All other style values are left untouched. The text color is the foreground color used along with the base color (see Gtk::Widget#modify_base) for widgets such as Gtk::Entry and Gtk::TextView. See also Gtk::Widget#modify_style.
    * state: the state(((<GtkStateType|Gtk#GtkStateType>))) for which to set the text color. 
    * color: the Gdk::Color to assign (does not need to be allocated). 
    * Returns: self

--- modify_base(state, color)

    Sets the base color for a widget in a particular state. All other style values are left untouched. The base color is the background color used along with the text color (see Gtk::Widget#modify_text) for widgets such as Gtk::Entry and Gtk::TextView. See also Gtk::Widget#modify_style.
    * state: the state(((<GtkStateType|Gtk#GtkStateType>))) for which to set the base color. 
    * color: the Gdk::Color to assign (does not need to be allocated). 
    * Returns: self

--- modify_font(font_desc)

    Sets the font to use for a widget. All other style values are left untouched. See also Gtk::Widget#modify_style.
    * font_desc: the Pango::FontDescription to use 
    * Returns: self

--- create_pango_context

    Creates a new Pango::Context with the appropriate colormap, font description, and base direction for drawing text for this widget. See also Gtk::Widget#pango_context.
    * Returns: the new Pango::Context

--- pango_context

    Gets a Pango::Context with the appropriate colormap, font description and base direction for this widget. Unlike the context returned by Gtk::Widget#create_pango_context, this context is owned by the widget (it can be used as long as widget exists), and will be updated to match any changes to the widget's attributes.
    If you create and keep a Pango::Layout using this context, you must deal with changes to the context by calling Pango::Layout#context_changed on the layout in response to the ::style_set and ::direction_set signals for the widget.
    * Returns: the Pango::Context for the widget.

--- create_pango_layout

    Creates a new Pango::Layout with the appropriate colormap, font description, and base direction for drawing text for this widget.
    If you keep a Pango::Layout created in this way around, in order notify the layout of changes to the base direction or font of this widget, you must call Pango::Layout#context_changed in response to the ::style_set and ::direction_set signals for the widget.
    * text: text to set on the layout (can be nil) 
    * Returns: the new Pango::Layout

--- render_icon(stock_id, size, detail=nil)

    convenience method that uses the theme engine and RC file settings for widget to look up stock_id and render it to a Gdk::Pixbuf. stock_id should be a stock icon ID such as Gtk::Stock::OPEN or Gtk::Stock::OK. Size should be a size such as Gtk::IconSize::MENU. detail should be a string that identifies the widget or code doing the rendering, so that theme engines can use special-case rendering for that widget or code.
    * stock_id : a stock ID(((<Gtk::Stock>)))
    * size : a stock size(((<Gtk::IconSize>))
    * detail : render detail to pass to theme engine(String or nil)
    * Returns : a new Gdk::Pixbuf, or nil if the stock ID wasn't known

--- queue_draw_area(x, y, width, height)

    Invalidates the rectangular area of widget defined by x, y, width and height by calling Gdk::Window#invalidate on the widget's window and all its child windows. Once the main loop becomes idle (after the current batch of events has been processed, roughly), the window will receive expose events for the union of all regions that have been invalidated.
    Normally you would only use this method in widget implementations. You might also use it, or Gdk::Window#invalidate directly, to schedule a redraw of a Gtk::DrawingArea or some portion thereof.
    Frequently you can just call Gdk::Window#invalidate or Gdk::Window#invalidate instead of this method. Those methods will invalidate only a single window, instead of the widget and all its children.
    The advantage of adding to the invalidated region compared to simply drawing immediately is efficiency; using an invalid region ensures that you only have to redraw one time.
    * x: x coordinate of upper-left corner of rectangle to redraw 
    * y: y coordinate of upper-left corner of rectangle to redraw 
    * width: width of region to draw 
    * height: height of region to draw 
    * Returns: self

--- reset_shapes

    Recursively resets the shape on this widget and its descendants.
    * Returns: self

--- app_paintable?

    Returns whether the application will paint directly on the widget.
    Returns: true if the application will paint directly on the widget.

--- app_paintable=(paintable)

    Sets whether the application will paint directly on the widget.
    * paintable: true to the paintable a widget.
    * Returns: paintable

--- set_app_paintable(paintable)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#app_paintable=.
    * paintable: true if the application will paint directly on the widget.
    * Returns: self

--- double_buffered?

    Returns whether the widget is double-buffered
    Returns: true if double-buffered

--- double_buffered=(double_buffered)

    Widgets are double buffered by default; you can use this method to turn off the buffering. "Double buffered" simply means that Gdk::Window#begin_paint_region and Gdk::Window#end_paint are called automatically around expose events sent to the widget. Gdk::Window#begin_paint diverts all drawing to a widget's window to an offscreen buffer, and Gdk::Window#end_paint draws the buffer to the screen. The result is that users see the window update in one smooth step, and don't see individual graphics primitives being rendered.
    In very simple terms, double buffered widgets don't flicker, so you would only use this method to turn off double buffering if you had special needs and really knew what you were doing.
    * double_buffered : true to double-buffer a widget 
    * Returns: double_buffered

--- set_double_buffered(double_buffered)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#double_buffered=.
    * double_buffered : true to double-buffer a widget 
    * Returns: self

--- redraw_on_allocate=(redraw_on_allocate)

    Sets whether a when a widgets size allocation changes, the entire widget is queued for drawing. By default, this setting is true and the entire widget is redrawn on every size change. If your widget leaves the upper left are unchanged when made bigger, turning this setting on will improve performance.
    Note that for Gtk::Widget::NO_WINDOW widgets setting this flag to false turns off all allocation on resizing: the widget will not even redraw if its position changes; this is to allow containers that don't draw anything to avoid excess invalidations. If you set this flag on a Gtk::Widget::NO_WINDOW widget that does draw on Gtk::Widget.window, you are responsible for invalidating both the old and new allocation of the widget when the widget is moved and responsible for invalidating regions newly when the widget increases size.
    * redraw_on_allocate : if true, the entire widget will be redrawn when it is allocated to a new size. Otherwise, only the new portion of the widget will be redrawn. 
    * Returns: redraw_on_allocate

--- set_redraw_on_allocate(redraw_on_allocate)

    Same as Gtk::Widget#redraw_on_allocate=.
    * redraw_on_allocate : if true, the entire widget will be redrawn when it is allocated to a new size. Otherwise, only the new portion of the widget will be redrawn. 
    * Returns: self

--- set_scroll_adjustment

    For widgets that support scrolling, sets the scroll adjustments and returns true. For widgets that don't support scrolling, does nothing and returns false. Widgets that don't support scrolling can be scrolled by placing them in a Gtk::Viewport, which does support scrolling.
    * hadjustment: an adjustment for horizontal scrolling, or nil 
    * vadjustment: an adjustment for vertical scrolling, or nil 
    * Returns: true if the widget supports scrolling

--- mnemonic_activate

    For widgets that can be "mnemonic_activated" (buttons, menu items, etc.) this method activates them. Activation is what happens when you press a mnemonic key on a widget during key navigation; clicking a button, selecting a menu item, etc. If widget isn't activatable, the method returns false.
    * Returns: true if the widget was activatable

--- region_intersect(region)

    Computes the intersection of a widget's area and region, returning the intersection. The result may be empty, use Gdk:Region#empty? to check.
    * region: a Gdk::Region, in the same coordinate system as Gtk::Widget#allocation. That is, relative to Gtk::Widget#window for Gtk::Widget::NO_WINDOW widgets; relative to the parent window of Gtk::Widget#window for widgets with their own window. 
    * Returns: A newly allocated region holding the intersection of widget and region. The coordinates of the return value are relative to Gtk::Widget#window for Gtk::Widget::NO_WINDOW widgets, and relative to the parent window of Gtk::Widget.window for widgets with their own window.

--- send_expose(event)

    Very rarely-used method. This method is used to emit an expose event signals on a widget. This method is not normally used directly. The only time it is used is when propagating an expose event to a child Gtk::Widget::NO_WINDOW widget, and that is normally done using Gtk::Container#propagate_expose.
    If you want to force an area of a window to be redrawn, use Gdk::Window#invalidate or Gdk::Window#invalidate. To cause the redraw to be done immediately, follow that call with a call to Gdk::Window#process_updates.
    * event: a expose Gdk::Event 
    * Returns: return from the event signal emission

--- style_get_property(property_name)

    Gets the value of a style property of the widget.
    * property_name: the name of a style property 
    * Returns: the property value

--- accessible

    Gets the Atk::Object.
    * Returns: the Atk::Object

--- child_focus

    This method is used by custom widget implementations; if you're writing an app, you'd use Gtk::Widget#grab_focus to move the focus to a particular widget, and Gtk::Container#focus_chain= to change the focus tab order. So you may want to investigate those methods instead.
    Gtk::Widget#child_focus is called by containers as the user moves around the window using keyboard shortcuts. direction indicates what kind of motion is taking place (up, down, left, right, tab forward, tab backward). Gtk::Widget#child_focus invokes the "focus" signal on Gtk::Widget; widgets override the default handler for this signal in order to implement appropriate focus behavior.
    The "focus" default handler for a widget should return true if moving in direction left the focus on a focusable location inside that widget, and false if moving in direction moved the focus outside the widget. If returning true, widgets normally call Gtk::Widget#grab_focus to place the focus accordingly; if returning false, they don't modify the current focus location.
    * direction: direction of focus movement (((<GtkDirectionType|Gtk#GtkDirectionType>)))
    * Returns: true if focus ended up inside widget

--- child_notify(child_property)

    Emits a "child-notify" signal for the child property child_property on widget. 
    This is the analogue of GLib::Object#notify for child properties.
    * child_property: the name of a child property installed on the class of widget's parent
    * Returns: self

--- freeze_child_notify

    Stops emission of "child-notify" signals on widget. The signals are queued until Gtk::Widget#thaw_child_notify is called on widget. 
    This is the analogue of GLib:Object#freeze_notify for child properties.
    * Returns: self

--- thaw_child_notify

    Reverts the effect of a previous call to Gtk::Widget#freeze_child_notify.
    * Returns: self

--- no_show_all=(no_show_all)

    Sets the "no_show_all" property, which determines whether calls to Gtk::Widget#show_all and Gtk::Widget#hide_all will affect this widget. This is mostly for use in constructing widget hierarchies with externally controlled visibility, see Gtk::UIManager. ((*Since 2.4*))
    * no_show_all: the new value for the "no_show_all" property (true or false)
    * Returns: no_show_all

--- set_no_show_all(no_show_all)

    Same as Gtk::Widget##no_show_all=. ((*Since 2.4*))
    * no_show_all: the new value for the "no_show_all" property (true or false)
    * Returns: self

--- no_show_all?

    * Returns: the current value of the "no_show_all" property. (true or false)

--- mnemonic_labels

    Returns an Array of the widgets, normally labels, for which self is the target of a mnemonic (see for example, Gtk::Label#set_mnemonic_widget). ((*Since 2.4*))
    * Returns: the Array of mnemonic labels

--- add_mnemonic_label(label)

    Adds a widget to the list of mnemonic labels for self. (See Gtk::Widget#mnemonic_labels). ((*Since 2.4*))
    * label: a Gtk::Widget that acts as a mnemonic label for widget
    * Returns: self

--- remove_mnemonic_label(label)

    Removes a widget from the list of mnemonic labels for this widget. (See Gtk::Widget#mnemonic_labels). The widget must have previously been added to the list with Gtk::Widget#add_mnemonic_label. ((*Since 2.4*))
    * label: a Gtk::Widget that was previously set as a mnemnic label for widget with Gtk::Widget#add_mnemonic_label

--- action

    Returns the Gtk::Action that widget is a proxy for. See also Gtk::Action#proxies. ((*Since 2.10*))
    * Returns: the action that a widget is a proxy for, or nil, if it is not attached to an action.

--- composited?

    Whether widget can rely on having its alpha channel drawn correctly. On X11 this function returns whether a compositing manager is running for widget's screen. ((*Since 2.10*))
    * Returns: true if the widget can rely on its alpha channel being drawn correctly, else false.

--- remove_mnemonic_label(label)

    Removes a widget from the list of mnemonic labels for this widget. (See Gtk::Widget#mnemonic_labels). The widget must have previously been added to the list with Gtk::Widget#add_mnemonic_label. ((*Since 2.4*))
    * label: a Gtk::Widget that was previously set as a mnemnic label for widget with Gtk::Widget#add_mnemonic_label

--- child_visible?

    Gets the value set with Gtk::Widget#child_visible=. If you feel a need to use this method, your code probably needs reorganization. 
    This method is only useful for container implementations and never should be called by an application.
    * Returns: true if the widget is mapped with the parent.

--- child_visible=(is_visible)

    Sets whether widget should be mapped along with its when its parent is mapped and widget has been shown with Gtk::Widget#show. 
    The child visibility can be set for widget before it is added to a container with Gtk::Widget#parent=, to avoid mapping children unnecessary before immediately unmapping them. However it will be reset to its default state of true when the widget is removed from a container.
    Note that changing the child visibility of a widget does not queue a resize on the widget. Most of the time, the size of a widget is computed from all visible children, whether or not they are mapped. If this is not the case, the container can queue a resize itself.
    This method is only useful for container implementations and never should be called by an application.
    * is_visible: if true, widget should be mapped along with its parent. 
    * Returns: is_visible

== Constants

=== GtkTextDirection

--- TEXT_DIR_NONE
--- TEXT_DIR_LTR
--- TEXT_DIR_RTL
=== GtkWidgetFlags

Tells about certain properties of the widget.

--- TOPLEVEL

    widgets without a real parent, as there are windows(Gtk::Window) and menus(Gtk::Menu) have this flag set throughout their lifetime. Toplevel widgets always contain their own Gdk::Window.

--- NO_WINDOW

    Indicative for a widget that does not provide its own Gdk::Window. Visible action (e.g. drawing) is performed on the parent's Gdk::Window.

--- REALIZED

    Set by Gtk::Widget#realize, unset by Gtk::Widget#unrealize. A realized widget has an associated GdkWindow.

--- MAPPED

    Set by Gtk::Widget#map, unset by Gtk::Widget#unmap. Only realized widgets can be mapped. It means that Gdk::Window#show has been called on the widgets window(s).

--- VISIBLE

    Set by Gtk::Widget#show, unset by Gtk::Widget#hide. Implies that a widget will be mapped as soon as its parent is mapped.

--- SENSITIVE

    Set and unset by Gtk::Widget#sensitive=. The sensitivity of a widget determines whether it will receive certain events (e.g. button or key presses). One premise for the widgets sensitivity is to have this flag set.

--- PARENT_SENSITIVE

    Set and unset by Gtk::Widget#sensitive= operations on the parents of the widget. This is the second premise for the widgets sensitivity. Once it has Gtk::Widget::SENSITIVE and Gtk::Widget::PARENT_SENSITIVE set, its state is effectively sensitive. This is expressed (and can be examined) by the Gtk::Widget#sensitive_with_parent.

--- CAN_FOCUS

    Determines whether a widget is able to handle focus grabs.

--- HAS_FOCUS

    Set by Gtk::Widget#grab_focus for widgets that also have Gtk::Widget::CAN_FOCUS set. The flag will be unset once another widget grabs the focus.

--- CAN_DEFAULT

    The widget is allowed to receive the default action via Gtk::Widget#grab_default.

--- HAS_DEFAULT

    Set by Gtk::Widget#grab_focus for widgets that also have Gtk::Widget::CAN_FOCUS set. The flag will be unset once another widget grabs the focus.

--- HAS_GRAB

    Set by Gtk.grab_add, unset by Gtk.grab_remove. It means that the widget is in the grab_widgets stack, and will be the preferred one for receiving events other than ones of cosmetic value.

--- RC_STYLE

    Indicates that the widgets style has been looked up through the rc mechanism. It does not imply that the widget actually had a style defined through the rc mechanism.

--- COMPOSITE_CHILD

    Indicates that the widget is a composite child of its parent; see Gtk::Widget#push_composite_child, Gtk::Widget.pop_composite_child.

--- APP_PAINTABLE

    Set and unset by Gtk::Widget#app_paintable=. Must be set on widgets whose window the application directly draws on, in order to keep GTK+ from overwriting the drawn stuff.

--- RECEIVES_DEFAULT

    The widget when focused will receive the default action and have Gtk::Widget::HAS_DEFAULT set even if there is a different widget set as default.

--- DOUBLE_BUFFERED

    Set and unset by Gtk::Widget#double_buffered=. Indicates that exposes done on the widget should be double-buffered.

=== GtkWidgetHelpType

--- HELP_TOOLTIP
--- HELP_WHATS_THIS
--- NO_REPARENT
--- NO_SHOW_ALL

== Properties

--- app-paintable: true or false (Read/Write)

--- has-default: true or false (Read/Write)

    Whether the widget is the default widget

--- has-focus: true or false (Read/Write)

    Whether the widget has the input focus

--- height-request: Integer (Read/Write)

    Override for height request of the widget, or -1 if natural request should be used

--- is-focus: true or false (Read/Write)

    Whether the widget is the focus widget within the toplevel

--- name: String (Read/Write)

    The name of the widget

--- no-show-all: true or false (Read/Write)

    Whether Gtk::Widget#show_all should not affect this widget. Default: false. ((*Since 2.4*))

--- parent: Gtk::Container (Read/Write)

    The parent widget of this widget. Must be a Container widget

--- receives-default: true or false (Read/Write)

    If true, the widget will receive the default action when it is focused

--- sensitive: true or false (Read/Write)

    Whether the widget responds to input

--- style: Gtk::Style (Read/Write)

    The style of the widget, which contains information about how it will look (colors etc)

--- visible: true or false (Read/Write)

    Whether the widget is visible

--- width-request: Integer (Read/Write)

    Override for width request of the widget, or -1 if natural request should be used
