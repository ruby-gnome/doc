= class Gtk::AccelGroup
A Gtk::AccelGroup represents a group of keyboard accelerators, typically attached to a toplevel Gtk::Window (with Gtk::Window#add_accel_group. Usually you won't need to create a Gtk::AccelGroup directly; instead, when using Gtk::ItemFactory, Ruby/GTK2 automatically sets up the accelerators for your menus in the item factory's Gtk::AccelGroup.

((*Note*))
that accelerators are different from mnemonics. Accelerators are shortcuts for activating a menu item; they appear alongside the menu item they're a shortcut for. For example "Ctrl+Q" might appear alongside the "Quit" menu item. Mnemonics are shortcuts for GUI elements such as text entries or buttons; they appear as underlined characters. See Gtk::Label.new. Menu items can have both accelerators and mnemonics, of course.

== Description

=== Example 1. Hello World with Ctrl + 'A'
 require 'gtk2'
 
 ag = Gtk::AccelGroup.new
 ag.connect(Gdk::Keyval::GDK_A, Gdk::Window::CONTROL_MASK,
           Gtk::ACCEL_VISIBLE) {
   p "Hello World."
 }
 
 win = Gtk::Window.new.add_accel_group(ag).show_all
 Gtk.main

=== Example 2. Hello World with 'B' (Using accel path)
 require 'gtk2'
 
 AccelMap.add_entry("<TEST Application>/test", Gdk::Keyval::GDK_B, 0)
 ag = Gtk::AccelGroup.new
 ag.connect("<TEST Application>/test") {
   p "Hello World."
 }
 
 win = Gtk::Window.new.add_accel_group(ag).show_all
 Gtk.main

== Class Methods
--- Gtk::AccelGroup.new
    Creates a new Gtk::AccelGroup.
    * Returns: a new Gtk::AccelGroup

--- Gtk::AccelGroup.activate(object, accel_key, accel_mods)
    Finds the first accelerator in any Gtk::AccelGroup attached to object that matches accel_key and accel_mods, and activates that accelerator. If an accelerator was activated and handled this keypress, true is returned.
    * object: the GLib::Object, usually a Gtk::Window, on which to activate the accelerator.  
    * accel_key: accelerator keyval from a key event  
    * accel_mods: keyboard state mask from a key event (((<GdkModifierType|Gdk::Window#GdkModifierType>))) 
    * Returns: true if the accelerator was handled, false otherwise  

--- Gtk::AccelGroup.from_accel_closure(closure)
    Finds the Gtk::AccelGroup to which closure is connected; see Gtk::AccelGroup#connect.
    * closure: a GLib::Closure  
    * Returns: the Gtk::AccelGroup to which closure is connected, or nil

--- Gtk::AccelGroup.from_object(object)
    Gets an array of all accel groups which are attached to object.
    * object: a GLib::Object, usually a Gtk::Window  
    * Returns: an Array of all accel groups which are attached to object  

== Instance Methods
--- connect(accel_key, accel_mods, accel_flags, closure)
--- connect(accel_key, accel_mods, accel_flags) {...}
    Installs an accelerator in this group. When accel_group is being activated in response to a call to Gtk::AccelGroup.activate, closure or block will be invoked if the accel_key and accel_mods from Gtk::AccelGroup.activate match those of this connection. 
    Note that, due to implementation details, a single closure can only be connected to one accelerator group.
    * accel_key: key value of the accelerator(the constants are in Gdk::Keyval)
    * accel_mods: modifier combination of the accelerator(((<GdkModifierType|Gdk::Window#GdkModifierType>)))
    * accel_flags: a flag mask to configure this accelerator(((<GtkAccelFlags|Gtk#GtkAccelFlags>)))
    * closure: GLib::Closure to be executed upon accelerator activation
    * {...}: if closure = nil and a block is given, the block will be invoked if the accel_key and accel_mods from Gtk::AccelGroup.activate match those of this connection. 
    * Returns: self

--- connect(accel_path, closure)
--- connect(accel_path) {...}
    Installs an accelerator in this group, using an accelerator path to look up the appropriate key and modifiers (see Gtk::AccelMap#add_entry). When accel_group is being activated in response to a call to Gtk::AccelGroup.activate, closure or block will be invoked if the accel_key and accel_mods from Gtk::AccelGroup.activate match the key and modifiers for the path. 
    * accel_path : path used for determining key and modifiers.  
    * closure: GLib::Closure to be executed upon accelerator activation
    * {...}: if closure = nil and a block is given, the block will be invoked if the accel_key and accel_mods from Gtk::AccelGroup.activate match those of this connection. 
    * Returns: self

--- disconnect(closure)
    Removes an accelerator previously installed through Gtk::AccelGroup#connect.
    * closure: the GLib::Closure to remove from this accelerator group  
    * Returns: true if the closure was found and got disconnected  

--- disconnect_key(accel_key, accel_mods)
    Removes an accelerator previously installed through Gtk::AccelGroup#connect.
    * accel_key: key value of the accelerator (Gdk::Keyval) 
    * accel_mods: modifier combination of the accelerator  (((<GdkModifierType|Gdk::Window#GdkModifierType>)))
    * Returns: true if there was an accelerator which could be removed, false otherwise  

--- query(accel_key, accel_mods)
    Queries an accelerator group for all entries matching accel_key and accel_mods.
    * accel_key: key value of the accelerator (Gdk::Keyval) 
    * accel_mods: modifier combination of the accelerator  (((<GdkModifierType|Gdk::Window#GdkModifierType>)))
    * Returns: an array of location to return the number of entries(Gtk::AccelGroupEntry) found, or nil.
--- lock
--- lock {...}
    Locks the given accelerator group. Locking an acelerator group prevents the accelerators contained within it to be changed during runtime. Refer to Gtk::AccelMap.change_entry about runtime accelerator changes. If called more than once, AccelGroup remains locked until Gtk::AccelGroup#unlock has been called an equivalent number of times.
    * {...}: If block is given, it is locked untill the whole of the block.
    * Returns: self

--- unlock
    Undoes the last call to Gtk::AccelGroup#lock on this accel_group.
    * Returns: self

--- find {...}
    Finds the first entry in an accelerator group for which block returns true and returns its Gtk::AccelKey. ((* Since 2.2 *))
    * {...}: a block to filter the entries of accel_group with  
    * Returns: the key of the first entry passing find_func. The key is owned by GTK+ and must not be freed.  

--- activate(accel_quark, acceleratable, accel_key, accel_mods)
    (no document) ((* Since 2.4 *))
    * accel_quark: String or Fixnum.
    * acceleratable:
    * accel_key: key value of the accelerator (Gdk::Keyval) 
    * accel_mods: modifier combination of the accelerator  (((<GdkModifierType|Gdk::Window#GdkModifierType>)))

== Signals
--- accel-activate: self, arg1, accel_key, accel_mods
     * self: Gtk::AccelGroup
     * arg1: GLib::Object
     * accel_key: Key code constants of Gdk::Keyval
     * accel_mods: ((<GdkModifierType|Gdk::Window#GdkModifierType>))

--- accel-changed: self, accel_key, accel_mods
     * self: Gtk::AccelGroup
     * accel_key: Key code constants of Gdk::Keyval
     * accel_mods: ((<GdkModifierType|Gdk::Window#GdkModifierType>)).
