= class Gtk::Statusbar

A Gtk::Statusbar is usually placed along the bottom of an application's main Gtk::Window. It may provide a regular commentary of the application's status (as is usually the case in a web browser, for example), or may be used to simply output a message when the status changes, (when an upload is complete in an FTP client, for example). It may also have a resize grip (a triangular area in the lower right corner) which can be clicked on to resize the window containing the statusbar.

Status bars in GTK+ maintain a stack of messages. The message at the top of the each bar's stack is the one that will currently be displayed.

Any messages added to a statusbar's stack must specify a context_id that is used to uniquely identify the source of a message. This context_id can be generated by Gtk::Statusbar#get_context_id, given a message and the statusbar that it will be added to. Note that messages are stored in a stack, and when choosing which message to display, the stack structure is adhered to, regardless of the context identifier of a message.

Status bars are created using Gtk::Statusbar.new.

Messages are added to the bar's stack with Gtk::Statusbar#push.

The message at the top of the stack can be removed using Gtk::Statusbar#pop. A message can be removed from anywhere in the stack if it's message_id was recorded at the time it was added. This is done using Gtk::Statusbar#remove.
