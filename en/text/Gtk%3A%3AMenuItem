= class Gtk::MenuItem
The Gtk::MenuItem widget and the derived widgets are the only valid childs for menus. Their function is to correctly handle highlighting, alignment, events and submenus. 

As it derives from Gtk::Bin it can hold any valid child widget, altough only a few are really useful. 

== Object Hierarchy
* Object
  * GLib::Instantiatable
    * GLib::Object
      * Gtk::Object
        * Gtk::Widget
          * Gtk::Container
            * Gtk::Bin
              * Gtk::Item
                * Gtk::MenuItem

== Class Methods
--- Gtk::MenuItem.new(label = nil, use_underline = true)
    Creates a new Gtk::MenuItem. 
    * label: the text label to display next to the radio button. 
    * use_underline: true if the label will be created underscores in label indicate the mnemonic for radio button. 
    * Returns: a new Gtk::MenuItem.

== Instance Methods
--- right_justified?
    Gets whether the menu item appears justified at the right side of the menu bar.
    * Returns : true if the menu item will appear at the far right if added to a menu bar.  

--- right_justified=(right_justified)
    Sets whether the menu item appears justified at the right side of a menu bar. This was traditionally done for "Help" menu items, but is now considered a bad idea. (If the widget layout is reversed for a right-to-left language like Hebrew or Arabic, right-justified-menu-items appear at the left.)
    * right_justified: if true the menu item will appear at the far right if added to a menu bar.
    * Returns: right_justified

--- set_right_justified(right_justified)
    Same as Gtk::MenuItem#right_justified=.
    * right_justified: if true the menu item will appear at the far right if added to a menu bar.
    * Returns: self

--- submenu
    Gets the submenu underneath this menu item, if any. See Gtk::MenuItem#submenu=.
    * Returns: submenu for this menu item, or nil if none.  

--- submenu=(submenu)
    Sets the widget submenu, or changes it. 
    * submenu : the submenu(a widget which is a subclass of Gtk::Widget)
    * Returns: submenu

--- set_submenu(submenu)
    Same as Gtk::MenuItem#submenu=.
    * submenu: the submenu(a widget which is a subclass of Gtk::Widget)
    * Returns: submenu

--- remove_submenu
    Removes the widget's submenu. 
    * Returns: self

--- accel_path=(accel_path)
    Set the accelerator path on menu_item, through which runtime changes of the menu item's accelerator caused by the user can be identified and saved to persistant storage (see Gtk::AccelMap#save on this).
    To setup a default accelerator for this menu item, call Gtk::AccelMap#add_entry with the same accel_path. See also Gtk::AccelMap#add_entry on the specifics of accelerator paths, and Gtk::Menu#accel_path= for a more convenient variant of this function. 
    This method is basically a convenience wrapper that handles calling Gtk::Widget#accel_path= with the appropriate accelerator group for the menu item. 
    Note that you do need to set an accelerator on the parent menu with Gtk::Menu#accel_group= for this to work.
    * accel_path: accelerator path, corresponding to this menu item's functionality, or nil to unset the current path.  
    * Returns: accel_path

--- set_accel_path(accel_path)
    Same as Gtk::MenuItem#accel_path=.
    * accel_path: accelerator path, corresponding to this menu item's functionality, or nil to unset the current path.  
    * Returns: self

--- select
    Emits the "select" signal on the given item. Behaves exactly like Gtk::Item#select. 
    * Returns: self

--- deselect
    Emits the "deselect" signal on the given item. Behaves exactly like Gtk::Item#deselect. 
    * Returns: self

--- activate
    Emits the "activate" signal on the given item. 
    * Returns: self

--- toggle_size_request
    Emits the "toggle_size_request" signal on the given item. 
    * Returns: the requisition to use as signal data. 

--- toggle_size_allocate(allocation)
    Emits the "toggle_size_allocate" signal on the given item. 
    * allocation: the allocation to use as signal data.  
    * Returns: self

== Signals
--- select: self
     * self: the object which received the signal.

--- deselect: self
     * self: the object which received the signal.


--- activate: self
    Emitted when the item is activated. 
     * self: the object which received the signal.

--- activate-item: self
    Emitted when the item is activated, but also if the menu item has a submenu. For normal applications, the relevant signal is "activate". 
     * self: the object which received the signal.

--- toggle-size-allocate: self, allocation
     * self: the object which received the signal.
     * allocation: the allocation to use as signal data.  

--- toggle-size-request: self, requisition
     * self: the object which received the signal.
     * requisition: the requisition to use as signal data.
