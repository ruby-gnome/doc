= module Gtk::FileChooser

Gtk::FileChooser is an interface that can be implemented by file selection widgets. In GTK+, the main objects that implement this interface are Gtk::FileChooserWidget, Gtk::FileChooserDialog, and Gtk::FileChooserButton. You do not need to write an object that implements the Gtk::FileChooser interface unless you are trying to adapt an existing file selector to expose a standard programming interface.

== Description

== Description

=== File Names and Encodings
When the user is finished selecting files in a Gtk::FileChooser, your program can get the selected names either as filenames or as URIs. For URIs, the normal escaping rules are applied if the URI contains non-ASCII characters. However, filenames are always returned in the character set specified by the G_FILENAME_ENCODING environment variable. Please see the Glib documentation for more details about this variable. 

==== Important
This means that while you can pass the result of Gtk::FileChooser#filename to open(2) or fopen(3), you may not be able to directly set it as the text of a Gtk::Label widget unless you convert it first to UTF-8, which all GTK+ widgets expect. You should use GLib.filename_to_utf8 to convert filenames into strings that can be passed to GTK+ widgets. 


=== Adding a Preview Widget
You can add a custom preview widget to a file chooser and then get notification about when the preview needs to be updated. To install a preview widget, use Gtk::FileChooser#preview_widget=. Then, connect to the GtkFileChooser::update-preview signal to get notified when you need to update the contents of the preview. 

Your callback should use Gtk::FileChooser#preview_filename to see what needs previewing. Once you have generated the preview for the corresponding file, you must call Gtk::FileChooser#preview_widget_active= with a boolean flag(true or false) that indicates whether your callback could successfully generate a preview. 

==== Example 2. Sample Usage

  preview = Gtk::Image.new
  filechooser.preview_widget = preview
  filechooser.signal_connect("update-preview") {
    filename = filechooser.preview_filename
    pixbuf = Gdk::Pixbuf.new(filename, 128, 128)
    preview.set_from_pixbuf(pixbuf)
    filechooser.preview_widget_active(have_preview);
  }
	

=== Adding Extra Widgets
You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options that are not present in the default design. For example, you can add a toggle button to give the user the option to open a file in read-only mode. You can use Gtk::FileChooser#extra_widget= to insert additional widgets in a file chooser. 

==== Example 3. Sample Usage

  toggle = Gtk::CheckButton.new("Open file read-only")
  toggle.show
  filechooser.extra_widget = toggle

((* Note *)): If you want to set more than one extra widget in the file chooser, you can a container such as a Gtk::VBox or a Gtk::Table and include your widgets in it. Then, set the container as the whole extra widget. 


=== Key Bindings
Internally, GTK+ implements a file chooser's graphical user interface with the private GtkFileChooserDefaultClass. This widget has several key bindings and their associated signals. This section describes the available key binding signals. 

==== Example 4. Gtk::FileChooser key binding example
The default keys that activate the key-binding signals in GtkFileChooserDefaultClass are as follows: 

* location-popup: Control-L 
* up-folder: Alt-Up 
* down-folder: Alt-Down 
* home-folder: Alt-Home 

To change these defaults to something else, you could include the following fragment in your .gtkrc-2.0 file: 

 binding "my-own-gtkfilechooser-bindings" {
   bind "<Alt><Shift>l" {
     "location-popup" ()
   }
   bind "<Alt><Shift>Up" {
     "up-folder" ()
   }
   bind "<Alt><Shift>Down" {
     "down-folder" ()
   }
   bind "<Alt><Shift>Home" {
     "home-folder-folder" ()
   }
 }
 
 class "GtkFileChooserDefault" binding "my-own-gtkfilechooser-bindings"


:The "GtkFileChooserDefault::location-popup" signal
 This is used to make the file chooser show a "Location" dialog which the user can use to manually type the name of the file he wishes to select. By default this is bound to Control-L. 
:The "GtkFileChooserDefault::up-folder" signal
 This is used to make the file chooser go to the parent of the current folder in the file hierarchy. By default this is bound to Alt-Up. 
:The "GtkFileChooserDefault::down-folder" signal
 This is used to make the file chooser go to a child of the current folder in the file hierarchy. The subfolder that will be used is displayed in the path bar widget of the file chooser. For example, if the path bar is showing "/foo/bar/baz", then this will cause the file chooser to switch to the "baz" subfolder. By default this is bound to Alt-Down. 

:The "GtkFileChooserDefault::home-folder" signal
 This is used to make the file chooser show the user's home folder in the file list. By default this is bound to Alt-Home.

--- action=(action)

    Sets the type of operation that the chooser is performing; the user interface is adapted to suit the selected action. For example, an option to create a new folder might be shown if the action is Gtk::FileChooser::ACTION_SAVE but not if the action is Gtk::FileChooser::ACTION_OPEN. ((*Since 2.4*))

--- filename=(filename)

    Sets filename as the current filename for the the file chooser; If the file name isn't in the current folder of chooser, then the current folder of chooser will be changed to the folder containing filename. This is equivalent to a sequence of Gtk::FileChooser#unselect_all followed by Gtk::FileChooser#select_filename. If either the folder couldn't be changed and the file wasn't selected, it raises Gtk::FileChooserError or Gtk::FileSystemError.

== Constants

=== Action

Describes whether a Gtk::FileChooser is being used to open existing files or to save to a possibly new file.  ((*Since 2.4*))

--- ACTION_OPEN

    Indicates open mode. The file chooser will only let the user pick an existing file.

--- ACTION_SAVE

    Indicates save mode. The file chooser will let the user pick an existing file, or type in a new filename.

--- ACTION_SELECT_FOLDER

    Indicates an Open mode for selecting folders. The file chooser will let the user pick an existing folder.

--- ACTION_CREATE_FOLDER

    Indicates a mode for creating a new folder. The file chooser will let the user name an existing or new folder.

=== Confirmation

Used as a return value of handlers for the confirm-overwrite signal. This value determines whether the file chooser will present the stock confirmation dialog, accept the user's choice of a filename, or let the user choose another filename. ((*Since 2.8*))

--- CONFIRMATION_CONFIRM

    The file chooser will present its stock dialog to confirm about overwriting an existing file.

--- CONFIRMATION_ACCEPT_FILENAME

    The file chooser will terminate and accept the user's choice of a file name.

--- CONFIRMATION_SELECT_AGAIN

    The file chooser will continue running, so as to let the user select another file name.

== Signals

--- current-folder-changed: self

    This signal is emitted when the current folder in a Gtk::FileChooser changes. This can happen due to the user performing some action that changes folders, such as selecting a bookmark or visiting a folder on the file list. It can also happen as a result of calling a method to explicitly change the current folder in a file chooser. 
    Normally you do not need to connect to this signal, unless you need to keep track of which folder a file chooser is showing. 
    See also: Gtk::FileChooser#current_folder=, Gtk::FileChooser#current_folder, Gtk::FileChooser#current_folder_uri=, Gtk::FileChooser#current_folder_uri. ((*Since 2.4*))
     * self: Gtk::FileChooser

--- file-activated: self

    This signal is emitted when the user "activates" a file in the file chooser. This can happen by double-clicking on a file in the file list, or by pressing Enter. 
    Normally you do not need to connect to this signal. It is used internally by Gtk::FileChooserDialog to know when to activate the default button in the dialog. 
    See also: Gtk::FileChooser#filename, Gtk::FileChooser#filenames, Gtk::FileChooser#uri, Gtk::FileChooser#uris. ((*Since 2.4*))
     * self: Gtk::FileChooser

--- selection-changed: self

    This signal is emitted when there is a change in the set of selected files in a Gtk::FileChooser. This can happen when the user modifies the selection with the mouse or the keyboard, or when explicitly calling functions to change the selection. 
    Normally you do not need to connect to this signal, as it is easier to wait for the file chooser to finish running, and then to get the list of selected files using the method mentioned below.

--- update-preview: self

    This signal is emitted when the preview in a file chooser should be regenerated. For example, this can happen when the currently selected file changes. You should use this signal if you want your file chooser to have a preview widget. 
    Once you have installed a preview widget with Gtk::FileChooser#preview_widget=, you should update it when this signal is emitted. You can use the methods Gtk::FileChooser#preview_filename or Gtk::FileChooser#preview_uri to get the name of the file to preview. Your widget may not be able to preview all kinds of files; your callback must call Gtk::FileChooser#preview_wiget_active= to inform the file chooser about whether the preview was generated successfully or not. 
    Please see the example code in the section called “((<Adding a Preview Widget|Gtk::FileChooser#Adding a Preview Widget>))”.

--- confirm-overwrite: self

    This signal gets emitted whenever it is appropriate to present a confirmation dialog when the user has selected a file name that already exists. The signal only gets emitted when the file chooser is in Gtk::FileChooser::ACTION_SAVE mode.
    Most applications just need to turn on the :do-overwrite-confirmation property (or call the Gtk::FileChooser#do_overwrite_confirmation= function), and they will automatically get a stock confirmation dialog. Applications which need to customize this behavior should do that, and also connect to the confirm-overwrite signal.
    A signal handler for this signal must return a Gtk::FileChooserConfirmation value, which indicates the action to take. If the handler determines that the user wants to select a different filename, it should return Gtk::FileChooser::CONFIRMATION_SELECT_AGAIN. If it determines that the user is satisfied with his choice of file name, it should return Gtk::FileChooser::CONFIRMATION_ACCEPT_FILENAME. On the other hand, if it determines that the stock confirmation dialog should be used, it should return Gtk::FileChooser::CONFIRMATION_CONFIRM. The following example illustrates this. ((*Since 2.8*)) 

      chooser = Gtk::FileChooserDialog.new("file save",
                                           nil,
                                           Gtk::FileChooser::ACTION_SAVE,
                                           nil,
                                           [Gtk::Stock::SAVE, Gtk::Dialog::RESPONSE_ACCEPT], [Gtk::Stock::CANCEL, Gtk::Dialog::RESPONSE_CANCEL])
      chooser.do_overwrite_confirmation = true
      chooser.signal_connect("confirm-overwrite") { |fc|
          retval = nil
          uri = chooser.uri
          if is_uri_read_only(uri)
              if user_wants_to_replace_read_only_file(uri)
                  retval = Gtk::FileChooser::CONFIRMATION_ACCEPT_FILENAME
              else
                  retval = Gtk::FileChooser::CONFIRMATION_SELECT_AGAIN
              end
          else
              retval = Gtk::FileChooser::CONFIRMATION_CONFIRM  # fall back to the default dialog
          end
          # return the wanted value
          retval
      }
      
      chooser.run { |response|
          if response == Gtk::Dialog::RESPONSE_ACCEPT
              save_to_file(chooser.filename)
          end
      }
      chooser.destroy
