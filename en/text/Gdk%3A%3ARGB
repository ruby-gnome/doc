= module Gdk::RGB
((<Gdk::RGB>)) converts RGB, grayscale, and colormapped images into the native window pixel format and displays them. It takes care of colormaps, visuals, dithering, and management of the temporary buffers.

== Module Functions
--- Gdk::RGB.colormap
    Retrieves colormap set by ((<Gdk::RGB>)).
    * Returns: The Gdk::Colormap set by ((<Gdk::RGB>)).

--- Gdk::RGB.visual
    Retrieves visual set by Gdk::RGB.
    * Returns: The Gdk::Visual chosen by Gdk::RGB.

--- Gdk::RGB.draw_rgb_image(win, gc, x, y, w, h, dither, buf, rowstride)
    Draws a rectangular RGB image in the Gdk::Drawable.
    * win: The Gdk::Drawable to draw in (usually a Gdk::Window).
    * gc: The ((<Gdk::GC>)) graphics context to control the drawing style.
    * x: The x coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle in the drawable.
    * y: The y coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle in the drawable.
    * w: The width of the rectangle to be drawn.
    * h: The height of the rectangle to be drawn.
    * dither: A ((<GdkRgbDither|Gdk::RGB#GdkRgbDither>)) value, selecting the desired dither mode.
    * buf: The 24-bit pixel data.
    * rowstride: The number of bytes from the start of one row in buf to the start of the next.
    * Returns: self

--- Gdk::RGB.draw_rgb_image_dithalign(win, gc, x, y w, h, dither, buf, rowstride, xdith, ydith)
    Draws an RGB image in the Gdk::Drawable, with an adjustment for dither alignment. This function is useful when drawing dithered images into a window that may be scrolled. Pixel (x, y) will be drawn dithered as if its actual location is (x + xdith, y + ydith). Thus, if you draw an image into a window using zero dither alignment, then scroll up one pixel, subsequent draws to the window should have ydith = 1.
    * win: The Gdk::Drawable to draw in (usually a Gdk::Window).
    * gc: The ((<Gdk::GC>)) graphics context to control the drawing style.
    * x: The x coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle in the drawable.
    * y: The y coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle in the drawable.
    * w: The width of the rectangle to be drawn.
    * h: The height of the rectangle to be drawn.
    * dither: A ((<GdkRgbDither|Gdk::RGB#GdkRgbDither>)) value, selecting the desired dither mode.
    * buf: The 24-bit pixel data.
    * rowstride: The number of bytes from the start of one row in buf to the start of the next.
    * xdith: x offset for dither alignment.
    * ydith: y offset for dither alignment.
    * Returns: self

--- Gdk::RGB.draw_gray_image(win, gc, x, y, w, h, dither, buf, rowstride)
    Draws a grayscale image in the Gdk::Drawable.
    * win: The Gdk::Drawable to draw in (usually a Gdk::Window).
    * gc: The ((<Gdk::GC>)) graphics context to control the drawing style.
    * x: The x coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle in the drawable.
    * y: The y coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle in the drawable.
    * w: The width of the rectangle to be drawn.
    * h: The height of the rectangle to be drawn.
    * dither: A ((<GdkRgbDither|Gdk::RGB#GdkRgbDither>)) value, selecting the desired dither mode.
    * buf: The pixel data, represented as 8-bit gray values.
    * rowstride: The number of bytes from the start of one row in buf to the start of the next.
    * Returns: self
    
--- Gdk::RGB.draw_rgb_32_image(win, gc, x, y, w, h, dither, buf, rowstride)
    Draws a padded RGB image in the Gdk::Drawable. The image is stored as one pixel per 32-bit word. It is laid out as a red byte, a green byte, a blue byte, and a padding byte.
    * win: The Gdk::Drawable to draw in (usually a Gdk::Window).
    * gc: The ((<Gdk::GC>)) graphics context to control the drawing style.
    * x: The x coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle in the drawable.
    * y: The y coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle in the drawable.
    * w: The width of the rectangle to be drawn.
    * h: The height of the rectangle to be drawn.
    * dither: A ((<GdkRgbDither|Gdk::RGB#GdkRgbDither>)) value, selecting the desired dither mode.
    * buf: The 32-bit pixel data.
    * rowstride: The number of bytes from the start of one row in buf to the start of the next.
    * Returns: self
