Rendering Context - OpenGL rendering context object

== Object Hierarchy

* Object
  * GLib::Instantiatable
    * GLib::Object
      * Gdk::GLContext

== Class Methods

--- Gdk::GLContext.new(gldrawable, share_list, direct, render_type)

    Creates a new OpenGL rendering context.
    * gldrawable: a Gdk::GLDrawable
    * share_list: the Gdk::GLContext with which to share display lists and texture objects. nil indicates that no sharing is to take place.
    * direct: whether rendering is to be done with a direct connection to the graphics system.
    * render_type: Gdk::GL::RGBA_TYPE or Gdk::GL::COLOR_INDEX_TYPE (currently not used).
    * Returns: the new Gdk::GLContext.

--- Gdk::GLContext.current

    Returns the current Gdk::GLContext.
    * Returns: the current Gdk::GLContext or nil if there is no current context.

== Instance Methods

--- gl_drawable

    Gets the Gdk::GLDrawable to which the context is bound.
    * Returns: the Gdk::GLDrawable or nil if no Gdk::GLDrawable is bound.

--- gl_config

    Gets the Gdk::GLConfig with which the context is configured.
    * Returns: the Gdk::GLConfig.

--- share_list

    Gets the Gdk::GLContext with which the context shares the display lists and texture objects.
    * Returns: the Gdk::GLContext.

--- direct?

    Returns whether the context is a direct rendering context.
    * Returns: true if the Gdk::GLContext is a direct rendering contest.

--- render_type

    Gets the render_type of the context.
    * Returns: Gdk::GL::RGBA_TYPE or Gdk::GL::COLOR_INDEX_TYPE.

--- destroy

    Destroys the OpenGL resources associated with the context.

--- copy(src, mask)

    Copy state from src rendering context to the context.
    mask contains the bitwise-OR of the same symbolic names that are passed to the GL.PushAttrib() function. You can use GL::ALL_ATTRIB_BITS to copy all the rendering state information.
    * src: the source Gdk::GLContext.
    * Returns: false if it fails, true otherwise.
