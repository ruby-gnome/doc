= class Gtk::Layout
Gtk::Layout is similar to Gtk::DrawingArea in that it's a "blank slate" and doesn't do anything but paint a blank background by default. It's different in that it supports scrolling natively (you can add it to a Gtk::ScrolledWindow), and it can contain child widgets, since it's a Gtk::Container. However if you're just going to draw, a Gtk::DrawingArea is a better choice since it has lower overhead.

When handling expose events on a Gtk::Layout, you must draw to Gtk::Layout#bin_window, rather than to Gtk::Widget#window, as you would for a drawing area.

== Object Hierarchy
* Object
  * GLib::Instantiatable
    * GLib::Object
      * Gtk::Object
        * Gtk::Widget
          * Gtk::Container
            * Gtk::Layout

== Class Methods
--- Gtk::Layout.new(hadjustment = nil, vadjustment = nil)
    Creates a new Gtk::Layout. Unless you have a specific adjustment you'd like the layout to use for scrolling, pass nil for hadjustment and vadjustment.
    * hadjustment : horizontal scroll adjustment, or nil 
    * vadjustment : vertical scroll adjustment, or nil 
    * Returns : a new Gtk::Layout 

== Instance Methods
--- put(child_widget, x, y)
    Adds child_widget to layout, at position (x, y). layout becomes the new parent container of child_widget.
    * child_widget: child widget(Gtk::Widget)
    * x: X position of child widget 
    * y: Y position of child widget 
    * Returns: self

--- move(child_widget, x, y)
    Moves a current child of layout to a new position.
    * child_widget: a current child(Gtk::Widget) of layout
    * x: X position to move to 
    * y: Y position to move to 
    * Returns: self

--- size
    Gets the size that has been set on the layout, and that determines the total extents of the layout's scrollbar area. See Gtk::Layout#set_size.
    * Returns: [width, height]
       * width: location to store the width set on layout
       * height: location to store the height set on layout

--- set_size(width, height)
    Sets the size of the scrollable area of the layout.
    * width : width of entire scrollable area 
    * height : height of entire scrollable area 
    * Returns: self

--- hadjustment
    This method should only be called after the layout has been placed in a Gtk::ScrolledWindow or otherwise configured for scrolling. It returns the Gtk::Adjustment used for communication between the horizontal scrollbar and layout.
    See Gtk::ScrolledWindow, Gtk::Scrollbar, Gtk::Adjustment for details.
    * Returns: horizontal scroll adjustment(Gtk::Adjustment)
--- hadjustment=(adjustment)
    Sets the horizontal scroll adjustment for the layout.
    See Gtk::ScrolledWindow, Gtk::Scrollbar, Gtk::Adjustment for details.
    * adjustment: new scroll adjustment(Gtk::Adjustment)
    * Returns: adjustment
--- set_hadjustment(adjustment)
    Same as Gtk::Layout#hadjustment=.
    * adjustment: new scroll adjustment(Gtk::Adjustment)
    * Returns: self

--- vadjustment
    This method should only be called after the layout has been placed in a Gtk::ScrolledWindow or otherwise configured for scrolling. It returns the Gtk::Adjustment used for communication between the vertical scrollbar and layout.
    See Gtk::ScrolledWindow, Gtk::Scrollbar, Gtk::Adjustment for details.
    * Returns: vertical scroll adjustment(Gtk::Adjustment)
--- vadjustment=(adjustment)
    Sets the vertical scroll adjustment for the layout.
    See Gtk::ScrolledWindow, Gtk::Scrollbar, Gtk::Adjustment for details.
    * adjustment: new scroll adjustment(Gtk::Adjustment)
    * Returns: adjustment
--- set_vadjustment(adjustment)
    Same as Gtk::Layout#vadjustment=.
    * adjustment: new scroll adjustment(Gtk::Adjustment)
    * Returns: self

--- width
    Gets the layout width. See Gtk::Layout#set_size.
    * Returns: width
--- width=(width)
    Sets the layout width. See Gtk::Layout#set_size.
    * width: the layout width
    * Returns: width
--- set_width(width)
    Same as Gtk::Layout#width=.
    * width: the layout width
    * Returns: self

--- height
    Gets the layout height. See Gtk::Layout#set_size.
    * Returns: height
--- height=(height)
    Sets the layout height. See Gtk::Layout#set_size.
    * height: the layout height
    * Returns: height
--- set_height(height)
    Same as Gtk::Layout#height=.
    * height: the layout height
    * Returns: self

--- bin_window
    Gets the bin_window. When handling expose events on a Gtk::Layout, you must draw to Gtk::Layout#bin_window, rather than to Gtk::Widget#window, as you would for a drawing area.
    * Returns: the Gdk::Window

== Properties
--- hadjustment: Gtk::Adjustment (Read/Write)
    The Gtk::Adjustment for the horizontal position

--- height: Integer (Read/Write)
    The height of the layout

--- vadjustment: Gtk::Adjustment (Read/Write)
    The Gtk::Adjustment for the vertical position

--- width: Integer (Read/Write)
    The width of the layout

== Signals
--- set-scroll-adjustments: self, arg1, arg2
     * self: a Gtk::Layout
     * arg1: a Gtk::Adjustment
     * arg2: a Gtk::Adjustment
