= class Gdk::EventButton
Used for button press and button release events. The Gdk::Event#event_type field will be one of Gdk::Event::BUTTON_PRESS, Gdk::Event::BUTTON2_PRESS, Gdk::Event::BUTTON3_PRESS, and Gdk::Event::BUTTON_RELEASE. 
Double and triple-clicks result in a sequence of events being received. For double-clicks the order of events will be: 

(1) Gdk::Event::BUTTON_PRESS
(2) Gdk::Event::BUTTON_RELEASE
(3) Gdk::Event::BUTTON_PRESS
(4) Gdk::Event::BUTTON2_PRESS
(5) Gdk::Event::BUTTON_RELEASE

Note that the first click is received just like a normal button press, while the second click results in a Gdk::Event::BUTTON2_PRESS being received just after the Gdk::Event::BUTTON_PRESS. 

Triple-clicks are very similar to double-clicks, except that Gdk::Event::BUTTON3_PRESS is inserted after the third click. The order of the events is: 

(1) Gdk::Event::BUTTON_PRESS
(2) Gdk::Event::BUTTON_RELEASE
(3) Gdk::Event::BUTTON_PRESS
(4) Gdk::Event::BUTTON2_PRESS
(5) Gdk::Event::BUTTON_RELEASE
(6) Gdk::Event::BUTTON_PRESS
(7) Gdk::Event::BUTTON3_PRESS
(8) Gdk::Event::BUTTON_RELEASE

For a double click to occur, the second button press must occur within 1/4 of a second of the first. For a triple click to occur, the third button press must also occur within 1/2 second of the first button press.

    Sets the x coordinate of the pointer relative to the window. 
    * x: the x coordinate of the pointer relative to the window
    * Returns: x
--- set_x(x)
    Same as Gdk::EventButton#x=.
    * x: the x coordinate of the pointer relative to the window
    * Returns: self

--- y
    Gets the y coordinate of the pointer relative to the window. 
    * Returns: the y coordinate of the pointer relative to the window
--- y=(y)
    Sets the y coordinate of the pointer relative to the window.

    * Returns: x_root
--- set_x_root(x_root)
    Same as Gdk::EventButton#x_root=.
    * x_root: the x coordinate of the pointer relative to the root of the screen
    * Returns: self
