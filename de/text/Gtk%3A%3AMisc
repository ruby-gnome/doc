= class Gtk::Misc
The Gtk::Misc widget is an abstract widget which is not useful itself, but is used to derive subclasses which have alignment and padding attributes. 
The horizontal and vertical padding attributes allows extra space to be added around the widget. 
The horizontal and vertical alignment attributes enable the widget to be positioned within its allocated area. Note that if the widget is added to a container in such a way that it expands automatically to fill its allocated area, the alignment settings will not alter the widgets position.
