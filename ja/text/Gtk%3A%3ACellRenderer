= class Gtk::CellRenderer
The Gtk::CellRenderer is a base class of a set of objects used for rendering a cell to a Gdk::Drawable. These objects are used primarily by the Gtk::TreeView widget, though they aren't tied to them in any specific way. It is worth noting that Gtk::CellRenderer is not a Gtk::Widget and cannot be treated as such. 

The primary use of a Gtk::CellRenderer is for drawing a certain graphical elements on a Gdk::Drawable. Typically, one cell renderer is used to draw many cells on the screen. To this extent, it isn't expected that a CellRenderer keep any permanent state around. Instead, any state is set just prior to use using GLib::Object property system. Then, the cell is measured using Gtk::CellRenderer#get_size. Finally, the cell is rendered in the correct location using Gtk::CellRenderer#render. 

There are a number of rules that must be followed when writing a new Gtk::CellRenderer. First and formost, it's important that a certain set of properties will always yield a cell renderer of the same size, barring a Gtk::Style change. The Gtk::CellRenderer also has a number of generic properties that are expected to be honored by all children.

== Instance Methods
--- get_size(widget, cell_area)
    Obtains the width and height needed to render the cell. Used by view widgets to determine the appropriate size for the cell_area passed to Gtk::CellRenderer#render. If cell_area is not nil, fills in the x and y offsets (if set) of the cell relative to this location. Please note that the values set in width and height, as well as those in x(x_offset) and y(y_offset) are inclusive of the xpad and ypad properties.
    * widget: the widget the renderer is rendering to
    * cell_area: The area a cell will be allocated, or nil  
    * Returns: Gdk::Rectangle.
       * x: location to return x offset of cell relative to cell_area
       * y: location to return y offset of cell relative to cell_area
       * width: location to return width needed to render a cell 
       * height: location to return height needed to render a cell

--- render(window, widget, background_area, cell_area, expose_area, flags)
    Invokes the virtual render function of the Gtk::CellRenderer. The three passed-in rectangles are areas of window. Most renderers will draw within cell_area; the xalign, yalign, xpad, and ypad fields of the Gtk::CellRenderer should be honored with respect to cell_area. background_area includes the blank space around the cell, and also the area containing the tree expander; so the background_area rectangles for all cells tile to cover the entire window. expose_area is a clip rectangle.

    * window: a Gdk::Drawable to draw to  
    * widget: the widget owning window  
    * background_area: entire cell area(Gdk::Rectangle). Including tree expanders and maybe padding on the sides.
    * cell_area: area normally rendered by a cell renderer(Gdk::Rectangle)
    * expose_area: area that actually needs updating(Gdk::Rectangle)
    * flags: flags that affect rendering(((<GtkCellRendererState|Gtk::CellRenderer#GtkCellRendererState>)))
    * Returns: self

--- activate(event, widget, path, background_area, cell_area, flags)
    Passes an activate event to the cell renderer for possible processing. Some cell renderers may use events; for example, Gtk::CellRendererToggle toggles when it gets a mouse click.
    * event: a Gdk::Event
    * widget: widget that received the event  
    * path: widget-dependent string representation of the event location; e.g. for Gtk::TreeView, a string representation of Gtk::TreePath  
    * background_area: background area as passed to Gtk::CellRenderer#render  
    * cell_area: cell area as passed to Gtk::CellRenderer#render
    * flags: render flags  
    * Returns: true if the event was consumed/handled, or false

--- start_editing(event, widget, path, background_area, cell_area, flags)
    Passes an activate event to the cell renderer for possible processing.
    * event: a Gdk::Event
    * widget: widget that received the event  
    * path: widget-dependent string representation of the event location; e.g. for Gtk::TreeView, a string representation of Gtk::TreePath 
    * background_area: background area as passed to Gtk::CellRenderer#render  
    * cell_area: cell area as passed to Gtk::CellRenderer#render  
    * flags: render flags(((<GtkCellRendererState|Gtk::CellRenderer#GtkCellRendererState>)))
    * Returns: A new Gtk::CellEditable, or nil
