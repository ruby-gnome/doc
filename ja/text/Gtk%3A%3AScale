= class Gtk::Scale
A Gtk::Scale is a slider control used to select a numeric value. To use it, you'll probably want to investigate the methods on its base class, Gtk::Range, in addition to the methods for Gtk::Scale itself. To set the value of a scale, you would normally use Gtk::Range#value=. To detect changes to the value, you would normally use the "value_changed" signal.

The Gtk::Scale widget is an abstract class, used only for deriving the subclasses Gtk::HScale and Gtk::VScale. To create a scale widget, call Gtk::HScale.new or Gtk::VScale.new.

== Instance Methods
--- digits
    Gets the number of decimal places that are displayed in the value.
    * Returns: the number of decimal places that are displayed.  
--- digits=(digits)
    Sets the number of decimal places that are displayed in the value. Also causes the value of the adjustment to be rounded off to this number of digits, so the retrieved value matches the value the user saw.
    * digits: the number of decimal places to display, e.g. use 1 to display 1.0, 2 to display 1.00 etc.   
    * Returns: digits
--- set_digits(digits)
    Same as Gtk::Scale#digits=.
    * digits: the number of decimal places to display, e.g. use 1 to display 1.0, 2 to display 1.00 etc.   
    * Returns: self

--- draw_value?
    Returns whether the current value is displayed as a string next to the slider.
    * Returns: whether the current value is displayed as a string.  

--- draw_value=(draw_value)
    Specifies whether the current value is displayed as a string next to the slider.
    * draw_value : true or false
    * Returns: draw_value

--- set_draw_value(draw_value)
    Same as Gtk::Scale#draw_value=.
    * draw_value : true or false
    * Returns: self

--- value_pos
    Gets the position in which the current value is displayed.
    * Returns: the position in which the current value is displayed.  

--- value_pos=(pos)
    Sets the position in which the current value is displayed.
    * pos: the position in which the current value is displayed.  
    * Returns: pos

--- set_value_pos(pos)
    Same as Gtk::Scale#value_pos=.
    * pos: the position in which the current value is displayed.  
    * Returns: self

== Properties
--- digits: Integer (Read/Write)

--- draw-value: true or false (Read/Write)
    Whether the current value is displayed as a string next to the slider

--- value-pos: Integer (Read/Write)
