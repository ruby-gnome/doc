= class Gtk::Arrow
Gtk::Arrow should be used to draw simple arrows that need to point in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right). The style of the arrow can be one of shadow in, shadow out, etched in, or etched out. Note that these directions and style types may be ammended in versions of Gtk to come. 

Gtk::Arrow will fill any space alloted to it, but since it is inherited from Gtk::Misc, it can be padded and/or aligned, to fill exactly the space the programmer desires. 

Arrows are created with a call to Gtk::Arrow.new. The direction or style of an arrow can be changed after creation by using Gtk::Arrow#set.
