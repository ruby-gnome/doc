Quark lists (lists of KEY=VALUE's).

== Object Hierarchy
* Object
  * GLib::Boxed
    * Gda::QuarkList

== Class Methods
--- Gda::QuarkList.new(string=nil)
    Creates a new Gda::QuarkList, which is a set of key->value pairs, very
    similar to GLib's GHashTable, but with the only purpose to make easier the
    parsing and creation of data source connection strings.
    You can optionally pass a connection string to initialize the quark list.
    * string: a connection string.  
    * Returns: a newly created Gda::QuarkList object.

== Instance Methods
--- add(string, cleanup=false)
    Synonym for Gda::QuarkList#add_from_string.
    * cleanup: whether to cleanup the previous content or not.  
    * string: a connection string. 
    * Returns: self.

--- add_from_string(string, cleanup=false)
    Adds new key->value pairs from the given string. If cleanup is set to true,
    the previous contents will be discarded before adding the new pairs.
    * cleanup: whether to cleanup the previous content or not.  
    * string: a connection string. 
    * Returns: self.

--- clear
    Removes all key->pair values from the quark list.
    * Returns: self.

--- find(name)
    Searches for the value identified by name in the quark list.
    * name: the name of the value to search for.  
    * Returns: the value associated with the given key if found, or nil if not found.
